*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI met Lonnigan as planned on Kurile yesterday and we came to an agreement on the price. The plan is to meet on Freeport 7 tomorrow to seal the deal on the ore shipment. If everything works out, they’ll owe me a million credits. It’s the deal of a lifetime.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I did the deal. I’m now the proud owner of over a ton of Boron. I put all my savings into this deal. It’s not entirely legal, but here in the Border Worlds, nobody really pays too much attention to this. I’ve been in contact with a man named Lonnigan. Apparently, he’s a hired gun representing Samura Heavy Industries. He says his clients might be interested in the shipment.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s been six weeks since my last entry. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find out anything about alien ruins or uncharted systems. Very frustrating. The only thing I’ve heard was that there’ve been sightings of strange ships out near Sigma-17. Who knows? The good news is that I’ve managed to hook up with a captain of a Republican Shipping convoy. He’s transporting a large shipment of Boron from Mainz to Honshu but wants to keep the profits for himself. We agreed to meet on Kurile tomorrow. We’ll see, maybe luck is on my side this time.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nAfter two weeks of travel, I finally managed to get to the Sigma system cluster. The trip through the Independent Worlds turned out to be much more dangerous than I thought. I was lucky several times that police patrols happened to be in the area when pirates wanted to blast me out of the stars. Anyway, word has it that there are several uncharted systems in this area of space. I will try to find out more information.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’ve finally decided to leave Bretonia and to try my luck in the Border Worlds. Despite what Tobias says, I can’t sit around Leeds for the rest of my life and fix up other people’s ships while more and more alien ruins are being discovered. They say that only 11 percent of the Border Worlds have been charted yet and hundreds of unknown planets are awaiting discovery. I’m starting this personal Neural Net Log to keep track of my travels and adventures.

A formerly hypothetical structure first described in 1959 A.D. by the physicist Freeman Dyson in a short paper entitled “Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation”, a Dyson sphere is an artificial hollow sphere of matter around a star designed to capture nearly all of the star’s radiated energy for industrial use. The original proposal by Dyson did not go into much detail about how a Dyson sphere would be constructed, focusing instead on the more fundamental issue of how an advanced civilization could expand its energy production to the maximum possible for a given solar system. Such a civilization would be classified as a Phase II civilization under the classification scheme developed by Nikolai Kardashev.

Arrival of Freeport 7 Survivors
15002
Just moments ago, the survivors of the Freeport 7 disaster arrived here in Manhattan. After two days of intense travel, several of the survivors required immediate medical attention. Requests by the LSF to conduct interviews concerning the attack have been declined by the medical commissioner. Meanwhile, the official death toll has risen to 2,600, making it the most devastating disaster in recent history.
15003
Rheinland Admiral in Manhattan
15004
Rheinland Admiral Otto Schultzky arrives in Manhattan today to meet with President Jacobi. Though they plan to discuss a new trade proposal, the President says that a heightened cooperative security measure will be on their agenda as well in light of the recent Freeport 7 tragedy. The admiral’s flagship, the RNC Donau, will arrive in Manhattan today under heavy guard.
15005
Jacobi Hopeful about Meeting
15006
The President was candid today when asked about her upcoming meeting with Admiral Schultzky. She said that despite recently strained diplomatic ties, this is a positive gesture from Chancellor Niemann. Jacobi and Schultzky have met on several occasions before his formal diplomatic appointment, and she has previously described him as “a man of reason, committed to peace.”
15007
Freeport 7 Public Reaction
15008
Citizens everywhere are still in shock at the news of Freeport 7’s destruction. The station, operated by the Zoners, served as a neutral trading facility for all walks of life from around the galaxy. In the face of the catastrophic loss of life and the growing consensus that this was most likely a deliberate attack, people are struggling to grasp the motive behind this senseless act of violence.
15009
Market Holds Trades
15010
In Manhattan, the center of galactic trade, all orders were held for one minute in honor of those lost on Freeport 7. The market remains more sluggish than usual at this time. However, analysts expect a full recovery.
15011
Liberty Mediates BW Talks
15012
Negotiations slowed to a crawl yesterday as delegates from Kusari and Rheinland heatedly debated acquisitions in the Border Worlds. Kusari had proposed a “full disclosure” initiative, which was protested and then effectively blocked by Rheinland. Recent territorial disputes in the Border Worlds, largely driven by the discovery of a wealth of new resources and Artifacts, have sparked these talks between the colonies, with Liberty acting as mediator. However, with the delegates now polarized over this issue, it is unclear how effective these talks will be.
15013
Military to Investigate FP7
15014
Government sources say that because of The Order’s potential involvement, President Jacobi has put the investigation of Freeport 7 into the hands of a special unit within the Liberty Military. This corps of investigators will be charged with securing the wreckage, gathering evidence, and coordinating with forensic teams in the solemn task of recovering and identifying human remains.
15015
Doctors Hold Off LSF Inquiry
15016
A group of Freeport 7 survivors, many of whom were critically injured, were taken to the Williams-Creek Medical Center for treatment. There they were triaged, and some underwent emergency, life-saving procedures. Agents of the LSF were also on hand to question those who could talk, but doctors insisted that they be allowed to recover before being subjected to the added stress. The LSF acquiesced but insisted that these patients be kept in a secure location within the medical center. Doctors have set aside Ward 13 for their convalescence.
15017
Schultzky Killed in Manhattan
15018
Rheinland Admiral Otto Schultzky has been assassinated by members of The Order! The President was visibly shaken when she heard that the ship carrying the Admiral was totally destroyed on its final approach to Newark Station. After extending her condolences to Rheinland, she ordered a full inquest, immediately charging the LSF to pursue The Order as its number one priority.
15019
Reaction to FP7 Investigation
15020
Other voices in Sirius have begun to question Liberty’s move to place military forces in what has always been an apolitical, neutral zone. Some have said that this investigation should be an open, pan-colonial undertaking and that the stationing of military forces in Sigma-17 violates charter settlement agreements between the Houses and other factions. To assuage these concerns, President Jacobi spoke, insisting that the recent movement of The Order required immediate action. She also stated that our forces were there to prevent further contamination of the area and to execute a thorough investigation — nothing more. Jacobi went on to stress that our formal presence at the Freeport 7 site would be exclusive and temporary, and that the sum of the findings would be shared with all affected government agencies.
15021
New York Crime Wave on the Rise?
15022
Are we at greater risk at home now more than ever? That’s the question. When The Order penetrated our defenses to kill Otto Schultzky nearly on the very steps of the presidential palace, many of our illusions about our own security were affected. Add to this the destruction of Freeport 7 and the sharp increase of attacks by the Liberty Rogues in New York, and we begin to feel anxiety and uneasiness about our personal and economic security. The President and the LSF say that they are addressing these concerns, but without concrete results, we are still left asking the questions, “Are these events related? And what can we do about The Order?”
15023
Niemann Blames Liberty for Death
15024
Chancellor Niemann of Rheinland spoke out bitterly today, citing lax security and blaming Liberty for the recent death of Admiral Schultzky during his visit. Niemann went on to say that he would personally punish those responsible, regardless of where they hide.
15025
FP7 Survivors to Talk
15026
Manhattan — Doctors at the WCMC have given the go-ahead for special LSF investigators to interview many of the Freeport 7 survivors. Despite an earlier recommendation against this course of action, we are told that government pressures have motivated physicians to allow at least a conditional line of questioning of select patients. It is hoped that their eyewitness testimony will help to shed some light on who truly is responsible.
15027
Local Crime Ring Smashed
15028
Seemingly in answer to growing security concerns, LSF forces took action and delivered a crushing blow to Liberty Rogues operating secretly near Pittsburgh. Following up on details from an ongoing investigation, the well-hidden base was rooted out and surgically eliminated by agents who acted under tactical LSF authority. Aemon Bonnerille of the LSF promises that this is just the beginning, as he intends to “tighten the noose around the neck of organized crime.”
15029
Local Prison Ship Rescued
15030
Just before LSF fighters closed in on a secret Rogue base near Pittsburgh, they were instrumental in fighting off a coordinated attack on a local prison ship. Prison Ship XT-19 is generally used as a staging area for prisoners being shuttled between processing stations and more permanent lockdowns in Texas. It was during such a transfer that the Rogues suddenly attacked and overran its defenses. Authorities believe that the Rogues were attempting to liberate a group of its own members being interrogated on board. Fortunately, however, the LSF arrived just in time to repel the pirates and avert disaster. Though XT-19 sustained heavy damage, we are told that the ship was successfully towed to Baltimore Shipyard for repairs.
15031
Liberty Imposes Artifact Ban
15032
President Jacobi announced today that, based on the appearance of new, unstudied, and potentially dangerous classes of Artifacts in Liberty, she is temporarily suspending all Artifact trading, pending further investigation. Despite initial protests, she has assured trade union reps that they will be adequately compensated and that, once evaluated, regulated trading will resume. Authorities have asked all citizens to comply with this temporary precaution until more can be learned.
15033
Big Guns Stand Vigil at Our Gates
15034
Responding to the public outcry on security issues, the government has now placed battleships at all Jump Gates on Liberty’s borders. Though some citizens are comforted by Liberty’s actions for better protection from both foreign attack and domestic smuggling and crime, others are concerned over the freedoms we might be sacrificing as we resort to potentially harsher military involvement to maintain security.
15035
Trouble in Zone 21?
15036
Civilian listening posts reported an unusual disturbance coming from Zone 21. Despite its exaggerated reputation among conspiracy buffs as an area for so-called “secret research,” Navy officials say that Zone 21 is only used for legitimate weapons testing and strategic training. They had no comment at this time about the disturbance.
15037
Evidence Pointing to The Order
15038
The LSF today has said that between the material retrieved from the Freeport 7 site and the weight of survivor testimony, there is sufficient evidence to support allegations that The Order did in fact participate in the Freeport 7 attack. Though officials have yet to ascribe a motive to The Order’s actions, or the exact weapons used, this new evidence has caused them to narrow their focus to establish an “operative presence” onboard the station before its destruction. They are now 100 percent confident that at least one Order member was on Freeport 7 hours before it was destroyed.
15039
Some FP7 Survivors Dead, Missing
15040
Doctors at the Williams-Creek Medical Center have reported several deaths in Ward 13, the sealed treatment facility for the survivors of Freeport 7. “These deaths are regrettable,” they say, but not surprising due to their extensive injuries. However, we’ve also learned that at least one patient appears to be unaccounted for at this time. Though doctors and LSF officials refused to comment, we understand that hospital security is looking into the matter.
15041
FP7 Manifest Sought
15042
As investigators search the Freeport 7 wreckage for clues, the one missing piece of the puzzle appears to be the station’s manifest. Once the manifest has been found and analyzed, authorities believe they will be able to accurately depict the final hours of the station right down to who was present on it, what ships were docked, and perhaps even how it might have been destroyed.
15043
Explosion in Zone 21 Was Attack
15044
After avoiding questions earlier, the Liberty Military has confirmed the sabotage of a Liberty cruiser in Zone 21. They also said that a coded transmission coming from within the cruiser just before its destruction was intercepted and deciphered. Based on the contents of the message, military authorities suspect operatives working for The Order. However, they do not know yet how saboteurs could have penetrated security to board the ship. The antimatter bomb that was detonated inside created a blast zone large enough to consume three cruisers and damage several nearby ships. There were no survivors in the suicide bombing, and the names of the ships and crewmen are being withheld at this time.
15045
Orillion Named as Order leader
15046
Today the President announced two contributions that advanced the exposure of The Order’s leadership infrastructure: evidence provided by the LSF, and the decoded transmission from Zone 21. Jacobi says that there are repeated references to a single individual known only as “Orillion.” LSF analysts believe this to be a codename. The President says that now it is only a matter of time before The Order will be rooted out and brought to justice.
15047
Pueblo Station Nearly Destroyed
15048
Reports have come in that Pueblo Station was viciously attacked by a well-organized band of smugglers under the direction of the notorious Sean Ashcroft. Even though rescue vehicles, medics, and LSF reinforcements arrived at the scene, damage to the station was nearly total, and Pueblo suffered many casualties. Ashcroft, a known Artifact smuggler, was subsequently apprehended by LSF agents and is being held in an unnamed LSF facility for questioning.
15049
LSF Tightens Criminal Noose
15050
LSF Director Aemon Bonnerille announced that his organization is continuing to tighten its grasp on piracy, smuggling, and all other illegal activities. Though some minor detractors claim that the methods being used are a violation of rights, others are relieved that the government is finally taking a more active role in domestic security.
15051
Kusari – Rheinland Anxiety Grows
15052
Despite repeated attempts by the President to smooth relations, Chancellor Niemann of Rheinland continues to insist that Kusari is guilty of theft, espionage, and now even conspiracy with The Order. Kusari has flatly denied these allegations, calling the Chancellor’s actions “slanderous,” and accusing Rheinland of taking armed action against Kusari ships in the Border Worlds.
15053
Rheinland Station Attacked
15054
More trouble in Rheinland — this time in the Hamburg system. Sources there report that a scientific research station was looted by marauders and left severely damaged. Investigators deny speculation that The Order might be involved, saying that evidence points instead to a small group of pirates allegedly backed by Kusari interests.
15055
Is Orillion Operating in Liberty?
15056
Sources say that there may be a relationship between organized crime and the movements of The Order. Moreover, there is a remote possibility that its leader, Orillion, may be operating within the confines of Liberty under criminal “protection.” Though the LSF has officially downplayed this idea, they say that they are following up on every legitimate lead to exposing Orillion, The Order, and whatever ties they may have.
15057
Rogue Attack on Ft. Bush
15058
Reports of an unprovoked Rogue attack on Ft. Bush surfaced today. Witnesses say that the Liberty Rogues suddenly appeared and began to attack several ships and the large station. This kind of attack is historically very unusual for them, say analysts, but consistent with recent Rogue behavior. Though the pirates were repelled and there was only minor damage reported by the station, this does raise some concern for the ongoing security issues in Liberty right now.
15059
Radicals Commit Suicide
15060
The Liberty Military reports that several subversives and radical sympathizers of The Order have recently committed suicide rather than face arrest. Although the names of these suspects are being withheld at this time, authorities say that they are still part of an ongoing investigation.
15061
LSF Conducts Internal Meetings
15062
With Liberty’s security in the balance, Aemon Bonnerille said that the LSF was developing a new internal plan for dealing with security issues. Though he declined to share the details of his new initiative, he has scheduled meetings with all key LSF control personnel.
15063
Kusari, Rheinland Square Off
15064
Shogun Edo of Kusari is said to have taken great umbrage towards recent remarks made by Chancellor Niemann. Edo bitterly dismissed the accusations of conspiracy and espionage, accusing the Chancellor of clouding the issues of his illegal operations in the Border Worlds and his infringement of the Boorman Treaty, which forbids armed aggression between the major Houses.
15065
Orillion Death Yields Few Answers
15066
Aemon Bonnerille, Director of the LSF, said, “I hope that with the death of Orillion, information about The Order’s operations in Liberty and elsewhere will be quickly discovered.” However, with more questions than answers right now, some people feel that the only man who could have shed light on Freeport 7 and other criminal acts was silenced by the LSF.
15067
Rheinland Foreign Minister Dead
15068
Karl Ettinger, Foreign Minister of Rheinland, was reportedly killed in a bomb blast earlier today. Ettinger was en route to inspect the remains of the Hamburg Station when a fusion bomb, apparently hidden in one of his attending ships, detonated, killing everyone. Rheinland authorities say they are investigating the site of the incident, but since the destruction was so utterly complete, they have little to go on at this time.
15069
Rheinland Ships in Liberty?
15070
Rheinland Military ships allegedly entered Liberty space today and opened fire without warning. The President immediately contacted Chancellor Niemann, who denied that there were any official military units in the area. Military officials had no immediate comment but said that the incident is under investigation.
15071
Rheinland Allegations
15072
Chancellor Niemann is said to have spoken directly with both President Jacobi and Queen Carina of Bretonia about the allegations he has raised against Kusari. Niemann has accused Kusari of backing The Order in its attacks against Rheinland and Liberty, and has now added the assassination of Karl Ettinger to his list of charges.
15073
Freeport 7 Manifest Found!
15074
The Freeport 7 data manifest has been found, according to the LSF. Agents finally discovered the sought-after module in a palette of wreckage reportedly salvaged by the Junkers. The data manifest, we are told, was acquired and immediately taken to the LSF labs for analysis. Based on the extracted data, investigators are certain that Orillion was indeed on Freeport 7 just before its destruction.
15075
Rheinland Fortifies KU Border
15076
There is what can only be described as a Rheinland Military buildup on their side of the shared border with Kusari. Chancellor Niemann says he will defend Rheinland against any more Kusari-based incursions even if it means taking matters into his own hands. Kusari, denying any wrongdoing, has deployed ships as well and adopted a defensive stance of its own in response to this action.
15077
Liberty, Bretonia Propose Summit
15078
Recent action on the Rheinland/Kusari border has caused other colonies great concern. In answer to this, President Jacobi and Lord Quigley of Bretonia have jointly proposed an emergency summit meeting to bring about a peaceful settlement. Lord Quigley, who has had a long career in successful diplomatic negotiations, is said to be acting under the direct wishes of his cousin, Queen Carina. There is no word yet on the Chancellor’s response to this proposal.
15079
Manifest Exposes Orillion
15080
Based on its most current evidence and testimony, the LSF believes that Orillion, a.k.a. Sam Lonnigan, came to Freeport 7 to steal several large shipments of unusually expensive goods and Artifacts that were in its bays. Once his agents took control of the shipments and presumably eliminated their rightful owners, it is believed that he ordered the ships to take off and destroy the station to cover their tracks. Lonnigan was likely to have been the last to leave. However, for whatever reason, he was caught in his own trap and was injured in the blast. Lonnigan was brought to Liberty by rescue ship and was admitted to the WCMC. Local Order operatives liberated him from Ward 13, and after his quick recovery, they implemented a wave of terror using Manhattan as a new base of operations. The LSF now says that it has all it needs to identify Lonnigan’s accomplices, who may still be at large.
15081
Boorman Treaty Violated?
15082
Shogun Edo now insists that Rheinland’s continued military actions show them to be in complete violation of the Boorman Treaty. Edo’s tone was almost accusatory in itself, as he asked why Liberty refused to help the Kusari people. The President, in fact, did speak to both powers today, asking them to reduce the buildup at their borders and to present their respective issues at the proposed summit meeting.
15083
Curaçao Summit is Now Set
15084
With Rheinland finally agreeing to attend, the summit meeting is now moving forward. Delegates, including our own Secretary Ballenshine representing Liberty, are to attend the meeting on Curaçao sometime in the coming week.
15085
Ballenshine Pronounced Dead
15086
Liberty Secretary James Ballenshine collapsed today and was evacuated to a government medical unit, where he was pronounced dead of natural causes. President Jacobi said that his sudden passing will not diminish Liberty’s commitment to peace and stability in the colonies. She will now be attending the summit meeting on Curaçao in his place.
15087
Rheinland Blockade in Omega
15088
In an unprovoked move, Rheinland has imposed blockades on Jump Gates in Omega-7. Officials have called this “an outrageous breach of trust and protocol that we cannot stand for.” Queen Carina and her cabinet have called for the Chancellor to immediately withdraw his forces, now impinging on Bretonian interests in that area. “Though we have been tolerant thus far,” the Queen said, “this hostile act casts a dark shadow on our relationship and will be met with equal force if need be.”
15089
Lord Quigley Gunned Down
15090
We are stunned by the news that Lord Arnold Benson Quigley, Foreign Minister to the Crown of Bretonia, has been found brutally murdered in his home. The Queen was informed and has firmly charged investigators to find those responsible. This is a duty, we are assured, they have solemnly accepted. Thus far there are no official suspects. However, an off-the-record source did say that they are not ruling out the work of The Order, who may be trying to derail the frail peace process in Sirius.
15091
Shots Fired on Bretonian Soil
15092
Conflict broke out in Omega today as Rheinland ships, becoming ever bolder, opened fire on a nearby Bretonian patrol in the area. The Chancellor has said that the Rheinland blockade is only looking after Rheinland’s interests in the area and claimed that they were provoked by Bretonian fighters. As tempers flare and peace hangs in the balance, Queen Carina contemplates her next move with her advisors.
15093
Are There Changes in Rheinland?
15094
News from the Foreign Office indicates that things may be heating up in Rheinland. Reports from the inside say that Rheinland citizens are being stirred up against Kusari by what is being described as “agitator groups.” Meanwhile, the Chancellor has just announced that the military is now activating its reserve fighters to bolster homeland defense. Royal analysts have reported this information to the Queen and have advised her that Rheinland may be preparing for war.
15095
Who Killed Lord Quigley?
15096
As national mourning continues for Lord Quigley, so does the manhunt for those responsible for his murder. Authorities, still tight-lipped about their investigation, have recently ruled out the involvement of many domestic suspects. This only further fuels local speculation that The Order may be directly responsible for Quigley’s death. However, we are told that this might not necessarily be the case. Based on new evidence, investigators are examining a host of foreign leads to find Quigley’s killers before they can act again.
15097
Queen to Attend Summit
15098
Despite Rheinland’s recent aggressive stance and the assassination of Lord Quigley, the Curaçao summit meeting is still set to proceed. In a surprise move, Queen Carina will now join President Jacobi and other representatives at the table, taking her cousin’s place.
15099
Disappearances Trouble HO
15100
Today in the Home Office, a report stated that missing persons cases are at their highest in years. Compared to other population centers in the galaxy, Bretonia has often been considered one of the more peaceful, and so these numbers are thought to be erroneous. The Home Office has asked for a recount and more information before it officially publishes its statistics.

Despite Liberty’s official statement that James Ballenshine died of “natural causes,” several entries in his sealed autopsy report detail certain anomalies. In information leaked to our press, it was noted that for a man who reportedly died of a heart attack, Mr. Ballenshine was in fact missing his heart altogether, as well as his eyes and his brain. These gruesome details were apparently omitted from Liberty’s records. However, they now indicate that Mr. Ballenshine was just another unfortunate victim in a wave of recent high-profile murders.
15103
Contact Lost with Remote Team
15104
Communication was lost today with a Cambridge University-sponsored archeological dig in the Border Worlds. University officials showed some concern, but in the absence of an emergency broadcast, they believe that the older communication equipment at the site must have failed. A repair crew will be dispatched to repair the problem.
15105
Shooting at Curaçao, Queen Safe
15106
In breaking news, shots rang out at the summit meeting on Curaçao, leaving one security officer dead. Fortunately, the delegates were safely evacuated, and the lone gunman was taken alive before further lives were lost. Authorities believe that his intended target was Gunther Obst, the Rheinland representative. Though the assassin’s identity has not been released, authorities have confirmed his ties to The Order. The Queen was unharmed in this altercation and remains under tight security.
15107
Rheinland Defectors?
15108
Reportedly, two individuals claiming to have information about the radical and sudden changes inside the Rheinland political machine have approached Bretonian authorities here at home. Requesting asylum and political protection, these people, whose names have been withheld, claim to have barely escaped a Rheinland death squad. As farfetched as it may sound, it seems our government has taken these individuals very seriously. They are currently being held in a secure location and have been granted an audience with the Home Secretary.
15109
Rheinland Leaves Negotiations
15110
The summit on Curaçao was brought back into session only to have it halt abruptly as Gunther Obst from Rheinland refused to re-enter the grand hall. Instead, Obst went into a closed-door, coded meeting with Chancellor Niemann, where he still remains.
15111
Summit Ends in Conflict
15112
Chancellor Niemann spoke today, insisting on the immediate departure of Gunther Obst from the Curaçao summit and dispatching several wings of fighters to escort him home. The Chancellor repeated earlier accusations against Kusari and all but accused Liberty of participating in a conspiracy to weaken Rheinland. He then declared Rheinland borders closed to all Kusari citizens traveling in or out.
15113
More Violence in Omega
15114
Rheinland forces again lashed out against Bretonian patrols. This time our ships fired back, crippling several Rheinland vessels. Chancellor Niemann decried the altercation as an act of hostility against the Rheinland state.
15115
Curaçao Delegates Return Home
15116
In light of recent events, all remaining delegates of the Curaçao summit have been recalled to their respective Houses. The Queen reaffirmed her support for the summit proceedings, hoping that when it resumes, it will act as an instrument to reestablish better understanding and lasting peace.
15117
Assassin Commits Suicide
15118
DNA samples taken from the would-be “Order assassin” match those of a Bretonian man reported missing in the Border Worlds five months ago. Hollings O’Keefe, who was apprehended after he opened fire on the Curaçao delegates, apparently died from a Cardamine overdose in his cell. O’Keefe, who had no criminal record before this incident, leaves a legacy of questions, since he died before authorities could learn any details about his disappearance or his subsequent connection to The Order.
15119
Kusari Citizens Arrested
15120
Reports indicate that soon after the Chancellor’s recent address, many Kusari citizens in Rheinland were placed under arrest “for their own safety.” Shogun Edo of Kusari was reportedly outraged at this news and demanded their immediate release. There has been no response yet from the Chancellor on this matter, but Queen Carina is also appealing for their release.
15121
Surge in Local Artifact Sales
15122
Local Artifact dealers report a marked increase in Artifact sales in recent weeks. Some of this, they say, can be attributed directly to Liberty’s imposed ban on their trade. However, they have also noticed an unusual number of foreign buyers, particularly from Rheinland. Sales topped at a record high again this week.
15123
Jacobi Addresses Rheinland
15124
President Jacobi responded to Rheinland’s recent closure of its borders with stateswoman-like aplomb. In her address, she asked Chancellor Niemann to reconsider this decision, to cease all hostile activities, and to release all Kusari citizens who are being held against their will. There has been no reaction yet from Rheinland.
15125
Kusari Convoy Attacked
15126
A Kusari convoy near the Kusari/Rheinland border fell to a Rheinland attack wing earlier, eliciting a blistering rebuke from Shogun Edo. The ships, which were on the Kusari side of the border, are said to have been carrying Food and medical supplies to one of Kusari’s outposts when the attack occurred.
15127
Carina Decries Actions
15128
Queen Carina spoke out against the recent attack of a Kusari medical convoy. In her statement, she appealed to Chancellor Niemann to end his aggression with Kusari and to work with the other colonies to find a more peaceful solution to their differences.
15129
Niemann Defends Actions
15130
Chancellor Niemann finally addressed the issue of Rheinland’s recent attack of a Kusari medical convoy. In his statement, he said that the Kusari convoy was operating under direct orders from the Kusari government to implant a “weapon of mass destruction” near an unspecified target in Rheinland space. Therefore, he said, this defensive attack was deemed necessary to preserve Rheinland lives.
15131
Edo Denies Allegations
15132
Shogun Edo dismissed the Chancellor’s statement that one of Kusari’s own medical convoys was being used to transport an explosive device into Rheinland territory. He warned Niemann that he could not allow this “wanton slaughter” to continue and insisted that Rheinland release the Kusari citizens that they were holding hostage.
15133
Device found in Convoy Wreck
15134
Rheinland officials have presented evidence in support of their claims that the Kusari medical convoy, recently destroyed by Rheinland ships, was actually on a covert “seek and destroy mission.” In their analysis, they discovered that a device, based on a fusion-bomb design, had been cleverly modified using Kusari components to be even more thorough in its destructive power. Meanwhile, Kusari officials demanded to inspect this so-called evidence, denouncing it as a feeble attempt by Rheinland to justify its war-like actions.
15135
Edo Asks for Support
15136
Kusari has appealed to the governments of Liberty and Bretonia in their dealings with Rheinland. Shogun Edo says that his principal concern is the welfare of his people still within Rheinland’s borders. He said that he is receiving enormous pressure to act militarily, but is still seeking a peaceful resolution.
15151
Rheinland Military Buildup
15152
In breaking news, large numbers of military ships have been reported on the move in Rheinland and have taken up position along the remainder of their borders. The Queen has taken issue with this action and is being kept apprised of things as they unfold. Despite the atmosphere of apprehension, commercial and civilian traffic on our side of the Gates continues.
15153
Travel Advisory for Bretonians
15154
Eyewitnesses in the Border Worlds say that Rheinland forces have intensified their presence and activities there, largely targeting the pirate population. In light of recent events, the Foreign Office has issued an advisory to all Bretonian subjects to use extreme caution when traveling outside of our systems.
15155
Jacobi Warns Rheinland
15156
In response to the arrival of more heavy-class Rheinland ships at Liberty’s border, President Jacobi has called for the Chancellor to immediately pull his forces back. Jacobi has also deployed her own defensive units and has warned the Chancellor not to enter Liberty space.
15157
Market Falters Amid Uncertainty
15158
Merchants at home and abroad are beginning to feel the economic hardships of our current political situation. With rising domestic strife and increased foreign threats, spending and trade have decreased in many areas, leaving us in something of a slump. Royal analysts say they are studying the problem and plan to offer a list of recommendations by week’s end.
15159
Jacobi Proposes Meeting
15160
In a formal address, President Jacobi said that matters with Rheinland had progressed to a level that she felt required more direct methods. She asked for representatives from Kusari and Bretonia to meet with her on Manhattan to discuss an initiative that she believes will defuse the situation with Rheinland while also allowing for the safe return of Kusari citizens.
15161
Kusari Citizens Still Held Hostage
15162
There is still no news on the fate of thousands of Kusari citizens being held captive by the Rheinland government. Though the Shogun has been successful in persuading Liberty and Bretonia to apply additional economic and political pressure on the Chancellor, the Shogun is also considering more direct military action.
15163
Tekagi Meets with Shogun Edo
15164
Governor Tekagi briefly met today with Shogun Edo to discuss the Rheinland conflict and Liberty’s proposed meeting. After the short, private discussion, the Governor said that he has been ordered to Liberty to “organize the release of our people through our allies.” Tekagi will leave at once to meet with President Jacobi.
15165
Liberty to Receive Tekagi
15166
Amid assurances of heightened security, President Jacobi prepares to receive our Governor Tekagi in the Presidential residence at an undisclosed time. Tensions remain high around Kusari, but the Governor says he is cautiously optimistic, particularly because Queen Carina of Bretonia will also be in attendance.
15167
Some Citizens Moved to Bremen
15168
We have just received word that many lawful Kusari citizens, wrongfully accused of espionage, have been rounded up and sent to a makeshift detention facility in Bremen. Officials are looking into this disturbing report.
15169
Tekagi Arrives in Liberty
15170
Governor Tekagi arrived in Manhattan today under well-armed escort. There he met with President Jacobi and Queen Carina, of Bretonia, in the hopes of establishing a joint resolution aimed at pressuring Rheinland to release its hostages and negotiate a peaceful settlement.
15171
Increased Tensions in Kusari
15172
Patrols have been increased around the Rheinland border in answer to the Chancellor’s recent actions. However, several civilian ships have reported unusual conditions around the area, including “radar ghosting” and other false readings. Some have speculated that Rheinland is attempting to jam early warning systems, but local officials dismiss these reports as the result of instrument malfunctions.
15173
Ban on Artifacts to Spread?
15174
Today Liberty unveiled what some have seen as an ulterior motive to negotiations on Manhattan: a potential ban on Artifacts throughout the colonies. Local Artifact dealers reacted negatively, particularly when learning that this ban would be administered by a separate, though still Liberty-run, agency.
15175
Speculation on Artifact Ban
15176
Authorities say that the President wants to extend the Liberty Artifact ban to the other colonies to better control the black market. Meanwhile, it appears that the Artifact market has shown signs of slowing slightly, thanks in part to Liberty’s resolutions and political lobbying. Sources inside Liberty say that shipment after shipment of confiscated Artifacts appear to be going into Zone 21 under military watch.
15177
Niemann Requests Tekagi
15178
Governor Tekagi’s mission in Liberty has reportedly gone well, yielding a series of directives for Rheinland. Interestingly though, once these directives were transmitted, word came back that the Chancellor would not accept them unless they were personally hand-delivered by the Governor. Despite being advised otherwise, Governor Tekagi has agreed to go.
15179
Amended Artifact Ban Signed
15180
Governor Tekagi left Manhattan, but not before endorsing an amended version of the controversial, joint ban on Artifact trading proposed by Liberty. After spending several hours in a secure-link conference with the Shogun, the two agreed to the ban in concept, but only as a temporary measure, and specifically as a means to better lawfully regulate the trade coming out of the Rheinland Border Worlds.
15181
Artifact Ban Limits Liberty
15182
As we learn more about the recent Artifact ban, we understand that this agreement also now limits Liberty’s access to the temporarily impounded Artifacts and now allows for the individual House to retain them within their own borders. This was good news to many merchants, as was the generous government subsidy. Meanwhile, Governor Tekagi heads back to Kusari briefly and then on to New Berlin.
15183
Carina Signs Artifact Ban
15184
On the heels of Governor Tekagi’s departure, Bretonia formalized its agreement with Liberty and Kusari by also signing the Artifact ban. It is hoped that this initiative will continue to put pressure on Rheinland and put much-needed government credits into the pockets of local merchants.
15185
Search for Kusari Transport
15186
The arrival of a special transport and her escorts from the Border Worlds is reportedly long overdue. Several patrols have been dispatched along the intended route, and though hopes of rescue are high, there has been no discovery of wreckage. The disappearance of the single vessel, carrying a cargo of new Artifacts bound for a museum in Kusari, is ironic since it falls on the cusp of the signing of the colony-wide Artifact ban.
15187
Tekagi Departs for Rheinland
15188
Concern is high for the Governor’s safety as he journeys to meet with Chancellor Niemann over the issue of the illegal detention of our people. President Jacobi says that she has confidence that a settlement will be reached with Rheinland, cautioning that any action taken against the visiting Governor would be met with swift retaliation from both Liberty and Bretonia.
15189
Special Guard Escorts Tekagi
15190
Governor Tekagi is meeting with Chancellor Niemann under the protection of the Shogun’s own Imperial Guard, who accompanied him through the blockade and to the Rheinland capital of New Berlin. The Governor was greeted with unusual warmth by the Rheinland Chancellor, who was himself surrounded by his own well-armed bodyguards. The two reportedly are going to meet privately to discuss the peace settlement and the safe release of the Kusari hostages. Today, all eyes are on Rheinland.
15191
Tekagi Returns in Triumph
15192
Governor Tekagi returned home after an extended meeting with Chancellor Niemann on New Berlin. While the fatigue of the journey appears to have taken its toll on the usually animated Governor, the meeting itself was reportedly a success. As a goodwill gesture, the Governor returned with 150 Kusari citizens who had been held hostage in Rheinland. The rest, we are told, will be returned in stages.
15193
Hostages Being Debriefed
15194
Governor Tekagi met privately with Shogun Edo immediately upon his return from New Berlin. There is no formal word yet from this meeting. Meanwhile, Intelligence officials have reportedly begun the process of debriefing the recently returned hostages. It is hoped that they will be reunited with their families and co-workers very soon.
15195
Kusari Transport Lost
15196
With no clues to its disappearance, officials have classified the transport that recently failed to report in from the Border Worlds as lost. The ships and crew names are being withheld until the families can be notified.
15197
Tekagi Exhausted from Trip
15198
After his return from Rheinland, Governor Tekagi is said to have refused food and sleep and might be ill. Though there is some speculation that he might have been exposed to something on the journey to or from Rheinland, sources close to the Governor say that he needs to rest.
15199
Chancellor wants Peace
15200
Advance word from the Shogun and Governor Tekagi is that Chancellor Niemann is willing to follow all of the directives outlined by Kusari, Liberty, and Bretonia if he is allowed more rights to territories in the Border Worlds. This is being considered by the Shogun, who has called a meeting with several of his top generals to review security concerns.
15201
Blood Dragons on the Move?
15202
Local authorities have reported that the Blood Dragons may be on the move again. Informants and intercepted communications alerted them to this possibility. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption. The Shogunate has said that the Blood Dragons do not represent a significant threat to our security at this time.
15203
RHEINLAND ATTACKS!
15204
Even as Shogun Edo considered Chancellor Niemann’s peace proposal and tensions along the Rheinland border appeared to ease, several Rheinland heavy cruisers and ships suddenly attacked Kusari forces, destroying at least one ship and killing over 100 soldiers. As a result of this unprovoked act, Shogun Edo has declared an open state of hostility with Rheinland — a precursor to war.
15205
Kusari Border Fortified
15206
With the escape of the attacking Rheinland ships back over the border, the Shogun has ordered immediate reinforcements to prevent any further assaults as offensive forces begin to mass. The Shogunate cautions that all ships passing through Kusari space are now subject to search and seizure. Travel outside of Kusari-controlled zones is not advised at this time for citizens.
15207
Liberty’s Bonnerille Dead?
15208
Word has surfaced here that Aemon Bonnerille, Director of the LSF, is missing and feared dead. There is no further information available at this time.
15209
RHEINLAND ATTACKS LIBERTY!
15210
In what has been described as an “intolerable act of open aggression,” warships from Rheinland attacked targets deep within the New York system today. Shortly thereafter, President Jacobi announced that she now had no choice but to declare war on Rheinland. Though she declined to answer specific questions, she did confirm that some Liberty military interests may have been affected by the attacks.
15211
Zone 21 Target of Attack
15212
Intelligence sources have confirmed that the Rheinland attack on Liberty centered around a military installation deep within the restricted area of Zone 21 in the New York system. In response, Liberty deployed a significant defensive perimeter around New York, including many heavy military vessels that are patrolling the perimeter of Zone 21.
15213
Bretonia Remains Vigilant
15214
Bretonian news feeds are reporting that the government is preparing for any movement against them by Rheinland forces, but as of yet, no attacks have occurred. However, tensions are mounting as several thousand anti-war demonstrators protest outside the Queen’s estate. No one was seriously hurt when riot police finally dispersed the demonstration.
15215
Missing Ship’s Last Message
15216
Sources say an Artifact-laden Bretonian ship, reported lost, was apparently attacked somewhere near Leeds. Bretonian investigators have reportedly discovered a weak transmission fragment that is believed to be the ship’s last message. What appears to disturb authorities the most about this fragment is the mention of “unmarked ships” that had come into range just before losing contact. As Bretonia continues to investigate, speculation here at home rises over recent ship disappearances.
15217
TEKAGI MURDERED!
15218
The Kusari people are in mourning today for one of the few great men of our time: Governor Yoshinobu Tekagi. Upon hearing of his murder by armed assassins, Shogun Edo was enraged and shouted for vengeance. An Imperial task force has been called in to investigate what is left of the Governor’s retreat.
15219
Tekagi Investigation
15220
As investigators speculate on the identity of the killers who took the life of the greatly beloved Governor Tekagi, they say that there is no concrete evidence to support The Order in the list of suspects. Despite suggestions that operatives from the Blood Dragons or even a Rheinland strike force may have played a role, Shogun Edo insists that The Order must be to blame.
15221
Bonnerille Alive and Well
15222
Director Aemon Bonnerille of the Liberty Security Force, who was previously thought to be missing, resurfaced today. In a press conference, he said that rumors of his disappearance were simply that — rumors. He blamed the irresponsible media for the controversy and confirmed that he had been sequestered in a secure location following a possible threat to his personal security.
15223
Dissension in Liberty?
15224
Unconfirmed reports state that several high-ranking admirals and government officials have started to criticize President Jacobi’s recent actions. There is even a rumor of some calling for her impeachment.
15225
Kusari Prepares for Invasion!
15226
Before being destroyed, probes from the Ministry of Strategic Information revealed that the Kusari government has been assembling a massive attack force behind the Honshu Jump Gate, a clear precursor to invasion. The Chancellor himself urged his people to remain united, and he pledged to seek out our enemies wherever they may be hiding. So let us support the Chancellor to assure a peaceful and united Rheinland.
15227
A Word of Truth
15228
The Ministry of Truth wishes to remind Rheinland citizens that all of the news and information coming through the official channels is personally viewed by our Chancellor. If he watches, shouldn’t you?
15229
Jacobi a Traitor?
15230
Sources inside the Chancellor’s office indicate that the power-hungry President of Liberty has severed all diplomatic ties with Rheinland — obviously in preparation for war. However, political unrest troubles her own government, as several high-ranking officers have publicly expressed their feelings that the President is working against the best interests of her people. Some allege that she could be guilty of corruption, possibly even treason.
15231
Liberty Suppresses Media!
15232
Elsewhere in the colonies, news of the Liberty President’s political troubles has been utterly suppressed by the “iron fist of the Liberty media machine.” We are grateful to the Chancellor and the Ministry of Truth for their tireless commitment to the freedom of information that we enjoy here in Rheinland.
15233
Heroic Chancellor Stands Firm
15234
In the latest threat from Liberty, President Jacobi has issued an ultimatum to our beloved Chancellor stating that we will be invaded unless we immediately disarm. The Chancellor defiantly declared that he will never let Kusari sap our vitality nor capitulate to Liberty’s bullying and self-serving tactics.
15235
Bretonia Still an Ally
15236
As Liberty continues to support the Kusari-backed criminals, guilty of terrorist activities against the sovereign state of Rheinland, and as Jacobi amasses her own invasion force, Bretonia appears to have come to her senses. The Chancellor, a long-time ally, is reportedly now reaching out to Queen Carina for her support in standing against Liberty’s empty threats.
15237
Jacobi Found Guilty
15238
The chief conspirator herself, President Barbara Jacobi, appears to be losing control, as pressure is being applied by the Liberty Navy and other leaders who want to remove her from office. Recent information shows that she may be guilty of treason and conspiracy with The Order. Perhaps it is time for the military to take control and initiate formal charges in the name of peace.
15239
TO VICTORY!
15240
With our destiny before us, we march on. The Chancellor has struck the first blow for the Rheinland state by crossing into Honshu and engaging the Kusari enemy. With our loyal support, our Chancellor will guide us to victory.
15241
WAR!!!
15242
IT’S WAR! Rheinland ships penetrated the Honshu defensive perimeter and are now in Kusari space. Our military forces have rallied, led by the Shogun and his Generals, and are successfully defending our cities. Soldiers, police, civilians, and even the unlawful have gathered together to fight the Rheinland invaders.
15243
Rheinland Crushes Criminals
15244
Today Rheinland peacekeepers met resistance from a weak and poorly organized criminal group. They were immediately neutralized and disarmed, and the survivors were captured for re-education and rehabilitation. Praise to the Chancellor for his mercy!
15245
Liberty President Missing
15246
Liberty feeds are buzzing with news that President Jacobi may be missing. Local LPI and LSF authorities were called to her residence where a violent struggle appears to have occurred shortly before dawn. Despite concerns that The Order may be involved, LSF Director Aemon Bonnerille says that he will do everything in his power to find the President.
15247
Coup in Liberty Reported
15248
Officials inside the Ministry of Truth say that there is every reason to believe that President Jacobi has fallen victim to a coup. The military leadership that is acting in her absence has full control of the government and is considering action against Kusari.
15249
Shogun’s Reaction
15250
In a carefully worded statement, the Shogun voiced his concerns that even “temporary military leadership” in Liberty might signal rough changes for Kusari. Reports indicate that several military leaders have echoed what could be construed as pro-Rheinland sympathies, which could shift the balance of power in the already tense conflict.
15251
President Jacobi Dead?
15252
President Jacobi of Liberty is missing and presumed dead. Calling it a “national emergency,” forces of the Liberty Navy have stepped in and taken control of all vital government and communication centers. Admiral Bill Baldwin has assumed leadership and established a temporary military government to oversee Liberty’s bureaucracy. No official statements have been issued at this time. However, we will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.
15253
Rheinland Rebels Take Out Base
15254
In a brief statement to Kusari news agencies, the Bundschuh rebels in Rheinland claim that they have assaulted and destroyed a high-security installation that housed illegal secret weapons built by the Chancellery. Naturally, this cannot be verified as of yet. However, a long-range scan does show a sizeable amount of irregular debris and radiation in that area.
15255
Kusari Fleet Destroyed
15256
In what has been described as the largest battle ever fought in the colonies, a massive Rheinland attack force completely destroyed the Kusari Fleet stationed in the Honshu system. Led by a group of over 40 Rheinland battleships, the Chancellor’s onslaught on Kusari seems unstoppable. The Shogun has mobilized all reserves, and the Kusari Naval Forces are now desperately attempting to establish a defensive ring around New Tokyo.
15257
Explosions in New York
15258
Incoming reports state that several large explosions have occurred near Zone 21. Although an official statement has yet to be issued by Admiral Baldwin’s new government, conflicting Intelligence reports have Kusari officials openly speculating that Liberty may be in the grip of an internal power struggle. Meanwhile, in related news, there is still no word regarding President Jacobi’s whereabouts or status.
15259
Renegade Killed
15260
In one of the very few official statements so far from the Baldwin regime, the Liberty Navy reports that the dangerous renegade Marcus Walker has finally been killed. Walker, previously a Navy Captain and leader of the former Liberty Attack Group South, had turned traitor and openly fought against the Liberty government for some time with his crew. According to the brief report, Walker’s cruiser was destroyed while he attempted to sabotage a naval installation at the southern edge of the New York system in Zone 21.
15261
Rheinland Takes New Tokyo
15262
The decisive battle in the war between Rheinland and Kusari ended in the total destruction of the Kusari Naval Forces near New Tokyo. Rheinland has erected a blockade around the planet and has made clear that only unconditional surrender from the Shogun can prevent a devastating planetary bombardment.

MISSION 1
21805

23805
OBJECTIVE:\nLord Hakkera’s key informant in Rheinland, Herr Von Claussen, has vital information about the Nomads. It is imperative to extract the informant alive. Fly to New Berlin, find Von Claussen and bring him back to Kusari space.\n\nDIFFICULTY:\nRheinland has declared war on Kusari and the Nomads now have complete control over the Rheinland Military. It will be difficult for anyone to get into the heart of Rheinland territory, but it likely will be harder to get out with a wanted spy on board.\n\nREWARD:\nThe survival of mankind in the colonies.
23806
OBJECTIVE:\nHerr Von Claussen’s contacts have located a secret experimental shipyard to the west of Bruchsal Base. Rheinland’s mobilization for war against Kusari has afforded us a rare opportunity. Form up with Herr Von Claussen and await further instructions.\n\nDIFFICULTY:\nEven with their forces spread thin, the installation will still be heavily guarded by both passive and active defenses. Herr Von Claussen’s extensive intelligence networks have been unable to retrieve tactical data on the area. No matter what, that installation must fall.\n\nREWARD:\nTime is running short for the colonies. This action will hopefully buy them the time they need.

*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI still can’t quite believe it. Lonnigan and I had just signed the deal when the attack occurred. We barely made it out alive. From the time the alert started, we only had a few moments before the station blew up. Hundreds of people weren’t so lucky. I actually had to carry Lonnigan to the Life Pod because a bulkhead collapsed during the attack and hit him in the head. He’s been unconscious ever since. The medics assure me that he’ll recover. I certainly hope so. We’re currently on a rescue ship en route to Manhattan, but things aren’t looking so good. I lost my ship and my ore shipment blew up with the rest of the station. All I have left is 500 credits. That wouldn’t even buy me a ticket back to Leeds on a waste disposal freighter.
30005
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, after several days of travel, we finally arrived on Manhattan. It was about time; the rescue ship was everything but a pleasant experience. The other eight survivors simply wouldn’t stop talking about what had happened on Freeport 7. Speculations were running wild, and just about everybody was accused at one point or another. Some were convinced Chancellor Niemann was behind the attack, and others accused Governor Tekagi. A Krüger rep assured me that Samura was the only possible group that had an interest in destroying Freeport 7. After a whole lot of useless debate, the majority seemed to agree in the end that The Order was behind it. Anyway, I have to say Manhattan is everything that Tobias made it out to be: a single giant city that covers almost the entire planet. They say that over 220 million people live here — unbelievable. The medics just took Lonnigan to intensive care in Medical. They said it’ll take a while until he’s released. No matter how long it takes, I’ll stay in Manhattan until he recovers. After all, we had signed the deal already. In the meantime, I should find a job. My 500 credits won’t last long. Maybe there is someone in the bar who could give me a lead.
30010
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nNice, after all I’ve been through. The bar here doesn’t even carry a Sidewinder Fang. The bartender served me a Liberty Ale — definitely the only one I’ll ever drink — but after talking for a while, he gave me something else, which was at least decent. He also pointed me to a Liberty Security Force officer who might have a job for me. Her name is Jun’ko Zane. She’s talking to some guy right now. I guess it’s okay for me to interrupt and see if she has something for me.
30015
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI talked to her. At first, she seemed pretty annoyed that I interrupted her conversation, but after she heard that I was on Freeport 7, she was a lot nicer. Seems like I could be in luck! She’s looking for a freelancer right now and said that she’d be in the equipment room later. I also have to remember to call her Juni, not Jun’ko. I’ll definitely look her up — it sounds promising.
30020
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI took the job. Juni offered me an old surplus Starflier and a few thousand credits. The ship is old and doesn’t have jump gate access, but it’s better than nothing. As long as I’m waiting for Lonnigan to recover, I don’t mind hanging around in the New York system for a while. The mission itself seems easy enough: escort a convoy of Food and medical supplies from Ft. Bush to Pittsburgh. I don’t really know where any of these places are, but she said the mission should be easy. I’m supposed to hook up with the mission CO King in space above Manhattan. Juni said my ship will be moved to the launch pad. All I have to do is get ready and launch into space.
30025
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI looked up Juni in the equipment room. She offered me an old and pretty crappy ship and a few thousand credits if I help escort a convoy of Food and medical supplies. Right now, I’m not really interested, but she said the offer would still stand if I come back later. She was certainly not pleased that I turned her down and told me that she’s my best chance for getting a ship. She could well be right. We’ll see.
30030
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAm I some sort of magnet for catastrophes? First Freeport 7 is destroyed while I’m on it, now I launch from one of the safest places in the colonies, the capital of Liberty, and a visiting Rheinland dignitary gets killed. I’m really starting to wonder. I know that I was looking for excitement and adventure when I left Leeds, but this has been a bit much lately. Anyway, King says that duty calls and that we have to rendezvous with the transports near Ft. Bush. He’s uploaded the coordinates of the first Trade Lane to my Neural Net. I guess it’s time to get going.
30035
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nEverything’s good so far. King and I are in formation with the transport convoy. Everybody here is pretty shaken about the attack on Schultzky. To top it all off, it seems the mission is quite a bit more dangerous than Juni made it out to be. The captain of the USV Brandt says that several convoys have come under attack en route to Pittsburgh in the last weeks. Liberty Rogues are hiding in the debris field surrounding the planet and are attacking convoys to and from Pittsburgh. We have to be careful.
30040
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat was everything but easy! I think I’ve been had! Turns out that this entire escort assignment to Pittsburgh was a covert operation by the LSF! The transport convoy was a ruse to draw the Liberty Rogues out of hiding. Well, that certainly worked — we barely made it out alive! King wants to go out again to search for a suspected Rogue base somewhere in the debris field. I signed up for the deal. I certainly don’t want to sit around on Pittsburgh. This has got to be one of the most desolate and sad places I’ve ever seen. King also promised me that it would be worth it. He’s waiting for me in space above Pittsburgh.
30100
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nKing and I hooked up with LSF patrol Epsilon 2 near Pittsburgh and had just started our search pattern when prison ship XT-19 sent a mayday. We immediately changed course and found the prison ship badly damaged and under attack by Rogue fighters. Good thing that we were in the area or that prison ship almost certainly would have been history. Anyway, we managed to destroy the Rogue ships. Patrol Epsilon 2 is staying here to protect XT-19 in case more Rogues show up. King and I will continue the search for the hidden Rogue base. The search pattern is in our Neural Net, and King told me to take the lead.
30105
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAfter we left the prison ship, King and I flew along the edge of the debris field heading toward our first search grid when we received another mayday, this time from the LSF fighter Beta 4. The ship was being chased out of the debris field by several pirate fighters. We managed to fight off the Rogues. Not a minute too early since Beta 4 was badly damaged. The pilot told the story of how his wing was destroyed in a nearby particle cloud. King believes that they had stumbled upon the hidden Rogue base. We have the coordinates, and King wants me to take the lead. This could get rough.
30110
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe did it! The Rogue base has been destroyed! Not to sound cocky, but we managed to hold off a small fleet of Rogue ships — not to mention that we took out these vicious weapon platforms. King and I held them off until several LSF wings arrived and finished them off with torpedoes. Pretty impressive! Anyway, King has uploaded coordinates to Pittsburgh. It’s time to head back.
30115
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nGreat! I risk my life for the LSF to take out this Rogue base here in New York and then King doesn’t even make good on the drink he promised me. Nice partner. Well, at least he transferred the money. I can’t wait to upgrade this ship, or as King likes to call it, this pile of junk. At the very least I want some better weapons. The Rogues weren’t that tough, but if I run into some stronger opposition, I need some better firepower.
30120
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni called in and told me that President Jacobi has ordered a full investigation into the assassination of Admiral Schultzky. Not surprisingly, it looks like The Order is behind it all. Juni said she’d have more work for me soon. In the meantime, she wants me to spread my wings and take a few missions here in New York. No kidding, given that my ship doesn’t have jump gate access. I couldn’t get out of this system even if I wanted to. Besides, I’m definitely going to wait for Lonnigan to recover. I want my money, damn it! Anyway, King told me that there should be a Deep Space rep on Pittsburgh that has a mission for me. We’ll see. Taking on small jobs like that should keep me busy until Juni calls me back.
30200
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt was about time! It’s been a while since I heard from Juni, but she just called and asked me to meet her on Manhattan. It looks like she has another assignment for me. I wanted to return to Manhattan anyway, to check up on Lonnigan.
30205
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI made it back to Manhattan. No word yet from Lonnigan. I’ve checked Medical, but nobody there seemed to know where he is. Nice bureaucracy! Anyway, I met Juni and King in the bar as planned and accepted their offer. It’s an interesting assignment, and it actually pays well. The LSF is going after a smuggler — a guy named Ashcroft, who is transporting illegal Alien Artifacts in and out of Liberty. Juni has information that Ashcroft is trying to move a shipment of Alien Artifacts through the Colorado Gate. King and I have to find the convoy and stop it before it can enter the New York system. The tricky part is that we are supposed to bring Ashcroft in alive. The LSF wants to interrogate him about Artifact trading in Liberty. President Jacobi has made it the top priority of the LSF to stop all Artifact trading — legal and illegal — and to seize every Artifact they can find. It’s all a little bit strange, really. Usually, these things are just collectibles for people with way too much money. I don’t think Jacobi has told the public the full story yet. The really good news about all this is that Juni has promised to give me the access codes to all Liberty Gates if we bring in Ashcroft.
30210
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI flew to Manhattan and met with Juni and King just now. It was good to see both of them again, but I’m not really up for the assignment. It involves hunting down some Artifact smuggler — not really my cup of tea. Juni actually said that she would wait for me since she apparently really wants me on that mission. I guess I’ll think about it.
30215
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI ran into Lonnigan on the landing pad. He was in pretty bad shape. Apparently, he actually escaped from Medical — no wonder I couldn’t find him before. That head injury must have been worse than I thought. He was totally confused, talked about people that were after him, and said that he knew who destroyed Freeport 7. Something about ships that weren’t there — a bunch of gibberish. I seriously thought he had lost his mind when suddenly two Liberty guards appeared and shot him with a smart dart. I had to dive out of the way or that thing would have hit me. Anyway, Lonnigan went down and I was still on the ground when one of the guards hit me with a stun baton. Not a pleasant feeling — it knocked me out in an instant. I have no idea how long I was out. The next thing I remember is Juni slapping me in the face. Looks like Lonnigan got himself into trouble with the local law. I’m starting to have the feeling that I’m never going to see my million credits. Oh, Tobias is going to have a field day. Looks like I’m going to have to work for Juni a while longer. I certainly need the money. Anyway, King is waiting for me in space above Manhattan.
30220
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe made it to the Colorado system. In response to the attack on Schultzky, the Navy has moved heavy battleships to all Jump Gates. I have to say — pretty impressive. We’re waiting for an update on the situation from Juni.
30225
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni just called in. Looks like Ashcroft is coming directly our way. His convoy has entered the Colorado system and the LSF has set up a trap near Pueblo Station. King and I have to scan every ship that comes through the Trade Lane to make sure that none of Ashcroft’s people get away.
30230
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, we scanned all the ships that came through the Trade Lane as ordered. Unfortunately, we got the wrong guy! We found a ship transporting illegal Artifacts and when King ordered the ship to stand down, he attacked. We thought it was one of Ashcroft’s men, but it turns out that we took down a guy named Cosmo Van Nostrom — a real pain. Anyway, just as King started to read him his rights, Juni called. The trap that the LSF had set up near Pueblo failed. Seems that Ashcroft managed to break through the blockade. Contact with Pueblo is lost. Juni wants us to fly there as fast as possible.
30235
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat was close. Pueblo was under attack by at least half a dozen of Ashcroft’s men. The station was burning and started to lose life support. They were lucky that we were so close. But even though Ashcroft got away, we might be in luck. The station managed to put a tracking device on one of Ashcroft’s ships. We have a signal, and this time he won’t get away.
30240
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe surprised Ashcroft while his people were unloading the Artifacts into smaller ships. It’s a good thing that Juni sent us support, otherwise this could have been too much for us. We managed to destroy most of Ashcroft’s fighters, but Ashcroft himself got away. He’s activated his cruise engines and headed deeper into the field. Thankfully, King tagged him. We’ll have to hurry or he’ll get away.
30245
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWow, that Ashcroft has a lot of friends. We chased him into the field, and he suddenly dropped out of cruise. I thought he was trying to get away by taking a Jump Hole, but it turns out that a whole bunch of his thugs were ready to take us down. In the end, we chased them off, and I have Ashcroft securely in my cargo hold. I expected this assignment to be harder than the one near Pittsburgh, but I had no idea how well equipped these Artifact smugglers are. It’s time to fly back to New York and deliver this guy to Juni. King uploaded the coordinates to the Colorado Gate — time to get going.
30250
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe’re back in New York. No more attacks, thank God. King told me an interesting story on the way. Seems like a Rheinland archeological expedition found an entire planet full of Artifacts recently, and here’s the kick — they seem to be active. Ever since then Liberty has tried to shut down the Artifact trade. I just can’t believe this. While I’m trading Boron, the Rheinlanders make the find of the century. What I would give to get my hands on one of these Artifacts. That was the very reason I left Leeds in the first place.
30255
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I hope the information the LSF is getting out of Ashcroft makes all of this worthwhile. King and I were attacked in the middle of the New York system by more of Ashcroft’s men. I had no idea how powerful these Artifact traders really are, and I bet the public in Liberty has no idea either. In any event, I delivered Ashcroft to Juni and she will try to squeeze information out of him. The good news is that I now have the access codes for all of the Liberty Jump Gates. This allows me to jump to Texas and California. Should be interesting since I’ve never been to either of these systems! I also got an extra bonus — not bad at all. Maybe I can buy a new ship. The fighter that King is flying looks nice. If that turns out to be too expensive, I could certainly use some better equipment and weapons. Juni said she would be on assignment for a while but that she would need me again soon. I’ll be waiting. For now, I can spend some time checking out the rest of Liberty space until she calls me again.
30300
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFinally! Looks like Juni is back from her assignment. She asked me to meet her on Manhattan.
30305
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThis is just great! I flew to Manhattan to meet Juni and to also see if I could find Lonnigan. Well, I didn’t have to — he found me and held a gun to my head! That guy has seriously lost his mind. He told me that he had killed a man today. He was still totally paranoid. Babbled something about Freeport 7 and Zone 21. I told him that I knew that The Order was behind it, but he seems to think that it was Liberty. He says it has something to do with Artifacts. Lonnigan said he wanted to warn me to get out of Liberty. I don’t know, he was different this time — seemed focused and determined — not at all the man who was confused just a few days ago. After this pleasant encounter, I went to the bar to meet Juni, and guess what — she wasn’t there. This whole trip to Manhattan is turning into a disaster. Well, at least she left a message with the bartender for me. I’m supposed to meet her on the terraforming station on California Minor. I asked the bartender — the California system is only one jump away from the New York System. All I have to do is take the Jump Gate to California. According to the bartender, there are Trade Lanes all the way up to California Minor. He’s uploaded the path to my Neural Net.
30310
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, at least Juni had the decency to call me. She says she needs me for an assignment. Apparently, Ashcroft’s interrogation was a success and yielded the information Juni and the LSF were looking for. I’m somewhat interested in what that thug had to say. When I’m in the mood, I’ll look her up on California Minor.
30315
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThings are really beginning to freak me out. I finally decided to meet Juni and just came out of the Jump Gate in California when I was stopped by a guy named Brandon Rowlett or something. He said he was with me on Freeport 7 and on the rescue ship. I don’t really remember him, but I think I know who this is — or rather was. The guy was pretty freaked out and told me that some survivors from Freeport 7 had disappeared. He wanted to meet me on Los Angeles, but just as we wanted to fly off, a Navy patrol came through the Trade Lane and shot him in cold blood. As the Navy ships flew off, they sent me a comm to keep this quiet. What the heck is going on? I guess I’ll keep it quiet, I don’t want to end up like Rowlett did!
30320
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI met Juni on California Minor. Wow, this place is basically a huge ice desert. Why anyone would want to settle here is a mystery to me. This has to be the worst bar in all of Liberty. Juni has less class than I thought. Her mission was interesting. Ashcroft claims that there is a traitor in the ranks of the LSF. Juni and I are to escort a convoy carrying Alien Artifacts from the Magellan system to a secret Navy research lab here in California. Only a few people know about the convoy and its cargo. If we are attacked, it would prove that there really is a traitor within the LSF or the Navy helping the Artifact smugglers. And just as we were about to leave, the News showed a breaking story that the leader of The Order had been killed. Guess what … they think it was Lonnigan! That’s the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever heard. He was a trader, and not even a good one. He didn’t plan the attack on Freeport 7, but he almost got killed in the blast. I tried to tell Juni, but she wouldn’t listen. I have to say that Rowlett was right about Freeport 7 survivors disappearing, and most of them violently. I have to be careful. As long as I work for the LSF, I should be pretty safe. I’ve to get going. Juni is waiting for me in space and given how moody she is, I better not let her wait too long.
30325
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nNo doubt about it … Juni is angry. I flew all the way out to this desolate planet and all she has to offer is a basic escort mission that doesn’t even pay very well. I told her that I wasn’t interested and Juni just about blew up on me. What a temperament! I might look her up later, after she has cooled off a bit.
30330
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe’ve reached the transports just before they entered the Barrera passage. The passage was built by the Navy Corps of Engineers and is basically a tube-shaped clearing through a dense ice asteroid field. Juni says that if there is an attack, it’ll be inside the passage. We have to stay sharp.
30335
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSo much has happened since my last entry. To say that we were attacked is an understatement. These Artifact smugglers seem to have a sheer endless supply of ships. We must have fought off 20 or more fighters in the passage and we were lucky that San Diego dispatched a fighter wing to help us, or we probably wouldn’t be here in one piece. If anyone needed proof that there’s a traitor somewhere in the LSF or Navy, I think we now have ample evidence. Juni landed on Willard to contact her superior. She says we have to fly back to California Minor.
30340
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat in the world is going on? After we left Station Willard, Juni told me that her CO has been placed under arrest for treason and that all of her friends at the LSF have somehow disappeared. She didn’t have an explanation, but maybe that traitor we were trying to weed out wasn’t alone. And then on our way back to California Minor, we were attacked by Rheinland Valkyries! I mean … what the hell are Rheinland ships doing in the middle of Liberty space? Seems to me that there’s a conspiracy going on and that it’s much more serious than we thought. Juni wants to meet a guy named Walker on California Minor. He’s the captain of a Liberty cruiser. Juni says we can trust him and that she knows him from the past. I hope she’s right.
30345
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe met Walker on California Minor. He’s a typical stiff military officer, but he seems okay. He even offered me a job with the Liberty Navy. If I ever take a job with these guys, I might as well admit to myself that my dreams of a life filled with adventure and discovery are over. Anyway, he promised to help us hunt down the Artifact smugglers here in California. The plan is to start our search near Station Willard and to take it from there. We’ll see if Walker can be trusted.
30350
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nRight as we left the planet, King called in. He confirmed that Juni’s CO is in prison. He also told us that there’s been a major shake-up in the ranks of the LSF. He seemed worried. But that’s not the last of it. As we entered formation with Walker’s cruisers, he contacted us on a secure channel to tell us that Navy High Command ordered his group back to space dock for inspection. He seemed very suspicious since his ships had been to space dock just two months ago. Suddenly, we picked up a mayday from Station Willard. Walker decided to disregard the High Command and ordered his group to head to the station. We have to hurry. The station reports that it is taking heavy damage.
30355
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat must have been the biggest battle since the Eighty Years’ War! Station Willard was under attack by several Rheinland gunboats and dozens of fighters. The station took heavy damage, and we barely managed to fight them off. There is general confusion as to what is going on. Walker and Juni are going to meet on the station to try to figure out what’s going on. Juni wants me to take a few jobs and to keep my head down. She promised to contact me once she knows more.
30400
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFinally, Juni called in. I was starting to get worried about her. She seemed concerned, almost frightened. I’m supposed to meet her on Manhattan. I should probably get there quickly and see what’s going on.
30405
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’ve never seen Juni like this. She’s scared — no other word to describe it. She flew back to New York to ask Ashcroft what Rheinland ships have to do with the Artifact trade in Liberty, but when she got to the battleship where he was being held, she learned that all records of his arrest had been wiped clean. But that’s not the worst of it. Walker’s also disappeared. Official records show that his ship was lost five years ago! Something is terribly wrong here in Liberty. Juni thinks our best shot is to look for Walker in California, and given that all other people I know here in Liberty are either dead or have disappeared, that sounds like our best option. Juni went back to the equipment room to take care of some business when I was cornered on the landing deck by a suspicious-looking guy. He told me that he and I were the last two survivors of Freeport 7. I vaguely remembered him from the rescue ship. He told me that the station was blown to pieces because people were looking for an Artifact he has in his possession. Just as he showed me the piece, a Navy officer appeared and shot him point-blank. I was almost next, but Juni came back just in time. She told him to take me into custody, but he turned on her and opened fire. She was faster, but now we’re really in trouble. Murder of a military officer is a capital offense here in Liberty and I doubt they’ll buy it was self-defense. We have to get out of here — fast — while there’s still time. Juni says she knows a place to hide.
30410
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLooks like Ashcroft and Walker have both disappeared. Something’s definitely wrong, but I don’t really want to get into it. I have my own problems. Juni wants to look for Walker back in California. I told her that I’m not really ready for this right now. I asked her to wait for me on Manhattan.
30415
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat the hell was all THAT about?! That had to be at least half the Liberty war machine! King tells me that my name suddenly showed up on top of the Navy’s most wanted list. I mean, what the hell? I’m wanted for murder, Artifact smuggling, treason, the destruction of Freeport 7, terrorism, and now we’re here with some old guy Juni knows. I should have never come to Liberty. Thank God Walker showed up though. I don’t think we could have made it out of that hellhole without him.
30420
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThree cruisers and a full escort wing, just for a single, one-man station? Juni seems to be holding together alright, but I don’t know how much longer we can hold out like this.
30425
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJeez, even the Bounty Hunters are coming at us in full force. We just can’t win, and everything keeps getting more and more confusing. We’re in it deep. Now we’re on a Lane Hacker base, of all things. I think we’re on the edge of Bretonian space. Maybe being a grease monkey wasn’t such a bad idea.
30430
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nRheinlanders?! What the hell was all THAT about?! What do they have to do with anything? Could it be that all of this is happening because of this damn artifact? I don’t know. All I know is that home in Leeds is just past the cloud. I’m sure Tobias will LOVE this story.
30435
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, Tobias set me up with a good chunk of money for a new ship and pointed me towards the New London ship dealer. Still, I haven’t been home in a while, and all that money is burning a hole in my pocket. After all that, I could use a drink.
30500
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLooks like Juni finally found something…. She sent me a message to meet her on Cambridge. Never liked going there — just a bunch of stuffy bookworms. She says she has a lead on Professor Quintaine. I better get going. The less time I spend in Bretonia the better.
30505
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I flew all the way to Cambridge to hook up with Juni. I know she’s trying to keep a low profile, and that sometimes means blending into public places, but jeez. I mean we always seem to meet in bars. And no surprise — the Professor has disappeared. It feels like a curse — anyone we’re trying to find either dies, is on the run, or magically disappears. In this case, however, Juni found a trail that might give us a chance to find Quintaine: a guy named Vance — he’s a pilot that used to help Quintaine get to the various archeological dig sites throughout the Border Worlds. He’s not too smart and way too much in love with the bottle to be totally reliable, but he seemed trustworthy. Juni had told him that we were working for the Hammer Research Institute in Liberty and that we were interested in funding some of the Professor’s research. That certainly opened some doors. Vance told us that the Professor sometimes disappears for weeks without telling anyone. That’s good news — he might still be alive. Vance pointed us to Dr. Sinclair, who has been working closely with Quintaine for years. She’s working on a dig site on Planet Sprague not too far from here in the Omega-3 system. Then, at the very end of the conversation, Vance told us that a group of Rheinlanders also came by today looking for the Professor. They claimed to be from the New Berlin Museum — fat chance. We have to hurry. If they get to Sinclair before we do, it’s over. Juni is waiting in space above Cambridge.
30510
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s always the same thing. If things don’t go the way Juni wants them to, she gets angry and obnoxious. All I told her was that I wanted a bit more time before I get deeper into this Quintaine business, and what does she do? She yells at me! I’ll hook up with her eventually, but for now, I’ll take all the time I want. We’re partners, right? Partners don’t lose it like that — not with each other.
30515
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI rendezvoused with Juni above Cambridge. She has already plotted the course to Sprague. It’s not very far. We’ll have to take the Trade Lane from here to the Norfolk and from there to the Omega-3 system. Once there, the quickest way is to fly to Freeport 1 and cut over to Sprague from there. The planet lies beyond the trade routes and is a bit remote, but overall, the trip doesn’t seem too bad. The only issues are these damn Rheinlanders. Hopefully, we’ll find the Professor first.
30520
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe just passed the Norfolk. Sounds like the conflict between Bretonia and Rheinland is escalating. We have to be careful. The Norfolk says that no Rheinland ships have been seen in Omega-3 yet. Maybe we’ll be lucky.
30525
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe’re in Omega-3 and just passed Freeport 1. It’s really starting to look like a military confrontation between Bretonia and Rheinland is becoming more and more likely. The Chancellor has ordered the Rheinland Military to set up blockades in the Omega-7 system, and no foreign merchant ships are allowed into Rheinland space anymore. We’re continuing on to Sprague. No sight of any Rheinlanders yet.
30530
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat the HELL?! These Rheinland ships came out of nowhere! Just as we were approaching Sprague a number of them just uncloaked directly in front of us. We managed to destroy them, but it was close. I hope they didn’t get to Sinclair before we did. We have to land as quickly as possible.
30535
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe found Sinclair, but just as we talked to her, the Rheinlanders attacked the dig site. How do they know where we are all the time? A good part of that blockade must’ve been waiting for us. They blew up the docking ring on the way out. Sinclair says she knows of a place nearby. This is gonna be close.
30540
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nDon’t know how we got out of there alive. I’ll give the Rheinlanders one thing — they’re persistent — annoying, but persistent. As always, another station I set foot on blows up. I’m really beginning to hate space, but I’m not about to die out here in the middle of nowhere. If I’m going down, I’m taking a few of those guys with me.
30545
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFor a scientist, Sinclair is a damn good pilot, but she’s a sad judge of character. So, two Rheinland “defectors” just happen to cross our path and are kind enough to just show us the way out. Riiiight. Why am I always the only one who picks up on this stuff? We just about got killed a few minutes ago by these same guys, and we’re all of a sudden following them around?
30550
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThe battleship Wotan. I’ve heard stories about it, but I’ve never seen it in person. Rheinland is being more than bold, bringing heavy capital ships this close to Bretonia and awfully close to home. I didn’t believe those two defectors at first, but after watching them take out that battleship, I’m guessing things aren’t exactly picture perfect in the Fatherland. Well, time to get back to Leeds. Bet Tobias can’t wait to see what followed me home this time.
30555
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLeeds — home sweet home. At least I know that no matter how bad things get, I can always come back to this bustling brown haven. At least we have a solid lead now, which I’m sure will send us right back into the fire. Well, at least I can breathe for a little and run around the old stomping grounds a bit. Tobias seemed enthralled with my new “friends.” He really hasn’t changed one bit.
30600
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nGreat — just great. Juni’s got me on this wild goose chase for some guy named Dexter Hovis out in the middle of the Dublin system. I bet he’s out on that abandoned battleship. Nothing but scum and gamblers out there. I think they were building some kind of race track out there, too. Maybe I’ll place a few down, seeing as I still haven’t been paid yet. I hope all of this gets us closer to finding out what that Artifact is all about.
30605
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I was right about the track, and I was right about the gambling. The only thing I didn’t see coming was that I’d be the main attraction. Wonderful. At least this’ll be easier than being shot at by Rheinlanders constantly. Apparently, you can’t place bets on yourself. Damn it, I’m never gonna get paid.
30610
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’m not racing this old, backwoods hick. What’s he doing out here anyway? Shouldn’t he be out in Texas or in the Border Worlds or something? Well, in any case, I’m not racing him just so he can get a sucker to burn. Juni will just have to find another lead.
30615
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOld hick got me the first round. He’s not going to get me again, though.
30620
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat bastard cheated! Lucky for him, I’ve got better things to do than beat old backwoods freaks like him back where they came from. Alright, Quintaine is supposed to be over on this old, abandoned station, the Glorious, not too far from here. Hovis had better be right about this, or I’m turning around and heading straight back. I‘ve had to deal with way too much to deal with some backwater idiot like him.
30625
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI don’t know what’s worse: these Rheinland guys who chase me to hell and back, or this old fart Quintaine. I’m trying to save him, and he dares to try to space me?! Well, at least maybe now we can answer a few questions. Still, I’m glad I’m not in the same ship as him. This entire trip has been nothing but one irritation after another.
30630
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThis Rheinland bit is getting old already. I’ve heard rumors that the Queen Mother is about ready to take up arms against Rheinland. Good, I’m tired of seeing them all over my backyard. You’d think in my own home system I’d be a little safer, but these guys just keep showing up. It’s because of things like this that I left to begin with. Still, if all this goes up in flames, I’ll never be able to find a good drink again.
30700
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFinally, I can get off this hunk of smoking rock and out of this stinking brown system. Juni needs me to help get Quintaine and Sinclair out of Bretonia. Every time that guy opens his big mouth, I want to stick my fist in it. If this is the best and brightest the colonies have to offer, we’re all doomed. I have to wonder — the last time I left Leeds I managed to piss off an entire government. I hope I can come back again one day.
30705
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni needs me to help get Quintaine and Sinclair out of Bretonia — the only problem is that I haven’t had a chance to step out and take a breather. I know they need me, but sometimes a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do.
30710
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThose bastards! They were right on my front door this time! I’m getting tired of this cat and mouse game. Why does everyone want this stupid rock so bad? And how did they get that deep into Bretonia? No matter where we go, there they are. It’s funny. I always thought that all of Tobias’ boasting about his days in the Royal Space Force was just that — boasting, but I’m sure glad he showed up. I owe him a lot, actually. One of these days I’m coming back here and repaying him for everything he’s done for me.
30715
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nDamn Rheinlanders are persistent! How are they blocking us in every direction? In any case, we’ve managed to get out of this mess, and we’re one step closer to … to … Where are we going anyway? Shinden, Shinagawa … Shinkaku! That’s it! We’re supposed to meet some guy named Kress. I hope whoever he is, he can get Quintaine and Sinclair out of my hair. Dealing with Juni is about all I can take as it is.
30720
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI was hoping Kress was there to take this old fart away! Oh well, it’s not too far from here — a small price to pay to keep from embedding my foot in his head. Tobias is going back home. I hope he doesn’t do some damn fool thing like re-enlist. Well, at least I won’t have too much to worry about. He’ll probably do something like hit on a higher-ranked female officer. I get the impression there weren’t any female pilots in his days. Heh, that’s Tobias though. Hope he’s gonna be alright. Well, off to Kress’ base.
30725
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFirst we have to go through this giant methane field into a giant open area of space where — surprise, surprise — a Rheinland fleet awaits us. This is NOT what I signed up for. Protecting the old windbag is hard enough; having to take on an entire fleet is not my idea of fun. It’s more like suicide. Kress’ men showed up, but they didn’t really help much. What good are scrub fighters against capital ships? Well, at least we got out of there alive. Maybe now I can finally dump this guy. ME-thane?! Who pronounces it like that?! It’s METH-ane! If this is the best scientific mind the universe has to offer, we’re all in a lot of trouble.
30730
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIf anyone gets to shoot Quintaine, it’s gonna be me, not some damned lackey. I’ve already been shot at, electrocuted, and nearly bombed to death. A good ol’ stand-off isn’t gonna shake me. Well, at least Quintaine is outta my hair. At least Sinclair was easy on the eyes. Well, on to Kyushu to meet a Lord Hakkera. I’ve actually never been to Kusari before. I’m very curious to see what it’s like.
30735
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSo that was Lord Hakkera. There’s an air about that man. I don’t know — he’s very … commanding. Anyways, Juni seems to know him, not that that’s saved us in the past. Hopefully, her home system will provide better protection than Bretonia. I guess I’ll do some sightseeing and take up a few jobs while I’m here. It’s not often I get to be a tourist.
30800
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThere’s something different about the people Juni knows in this system. They’re so strong in their convictions — kinda makes me forget about more trivial things. That reminds me — I still haven’t gotten paid! Well, in any case, we’re off to intercept some transport with one of the heads of the Kusari government, Governor Tekagi, on board. I’ve read about this guy in the news. I thought he was working for peace, but if there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that things aren’t always as they seem.
30805
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni seemed sad that I couldn’t accept the mission, but I still have things to take care of before I’m ready to take this one. If there’s one thing I’ve learned after being chased out of two of the houses, it’s that it’s always best to be prepared.
30810
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe ended up taking this really backwards way to Honshu, mostly due to the fact we had to join up with a Blood Dragon wing. I’ve heard of these guys before. They’re this weird type of “good pirate” that roams through Kusari. People say that they’re the best pilots anywhere in the colonies. That doesn’t help explain Juni’s piloting abilities. Well, we still have one more leg on this journey. We have to get that transport out of impound and get it to the Blood Dragon home, the legendary Kyoto Base.
30815
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe got the transport! That actually wasn’t too hard, but I think that’s due in part to Ozu. I’ve never seen anything so surgical before. Ozu’s men knew exactly what to do. It was almost poetic. No wonder these guys are known as legends.
30820
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nTekagi wasn’t aboard and neither was the Tome! Ozu seems unfazed by all of this — I don’t know how. I guess this all just comes naturally to him. I can see why everyone around here reveres him so much. So, this is the legendary Kyoto Base. I guess I’ll take some jobs and earn some scratch while Ozu and the Blood Dragons come up with another way to find the Tome. This place isn’t much to look at, but they’ve got some great equipment here. I can certainly get used to the way they dress.
30900
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nGreat, we’re going into a heavily defended fortress to retrieve a scroll, of all things. Normally this kind of thing would bother me, but there’s something about the Blood Dragons that makes you want to try, if not for you, for everyone else. Heh, maybe this constant hell I’ve been through in the last few weeks is changing me, or maybe it’s just the sense of determination around here.
30905
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt felt horrible telling Ozu that I wasn’t ready for this mission. He seemed disappointed in me. I don’t know what it is, but I feel like I have to earn his respect. I have to get ready for this, I can’t let the Blood Dragons down.
30910
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni seemed rather angry that we didn’t tell her we were leaving. There was a different sound in her voice though. She sounded kind of disappointed. In any case, I leave this mission in Ozu’s hands. He’s the first person I’ve trusted in a long time not to screw things up. We’re supposed to meet several wings of Blood Dragons along the way. That worries me. Just a few of these guys could take out a fleet. What kind of defenses are there that require several wings of Blood Dragons?
30915
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThings are starting to heat up. Tekagi’s men are easily just as good as the Blood Dragons, and they’re coming in equal numbers. No wonder Ozu joined up with so many wings. We had to take out the energy generators on the shield to get into this thing. The way I understand it, it used to be one of the wonders of Kusari. Now it’s a fortress.
30920
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat the hell was THAT! That thing killed Ozu in cold blood! What is going on here?! This was supposed to be a simple little mission — then the fat man’s eyes start glowing. Excellent, all this way to see Ozu die. I wouldn’t have even made it out if it wasn’t for Lord Hakkera. How did he get that ship in here anyway? No time to mourn, gotta get outta here before something else shows up intent on killing us. Ozu … sensei … sayonara….
30925
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni ended up meeting us along the way, but so did a few Rheinlanders. These guys just don’t quit. A few moments and torpedoes later and it was over. Juni seemed very saddened by Ozu’s death. I could tell from the tone in her voice. Anyway, Hakkera and the remaining Blood Dragons are taking us back to Kyoto so we can regroup. All this is just getting to be too much. This isn’t what I signed up for.
30930
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI kind of snapped at Hakkera when we landed. So many people have died, and it seems like this constant hunt Rheinland has for us is never going to end. I really wasn’t expecting all this when I first met Juni on Manhattan. I just wanted to make some cash and explore the galaxy. Now I’m some kind of freedom fighter. I’d give anything to have Freeport 7 back and for Lonnigan to have just given me my money. It seems like war is breaking out everywhere, though, and I guess if I wasn’t here, things would be just as bad everywhere else. I better take on a few missions and load up. I’m willing to bet things are about to go to hell.
30935
*Trent’s Log
31000
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAfter everything that’s happened, I don’t know what to make of things anymore. Juni’s asked me to meet her back on Kyoto. Apparently, Lord Hakkera needs me for a job that only I can do. I can only assume that this will translate into being shot at — a lot.
31005
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI can’t say no to Hakkera. He saved my life back at the Arch, and I have to return the favor. Still, into the heart of Rheinland? This mission is suicide, but I guess I’ve earned myself quite the reputation for blindly accepting just about anything, no matter how suicidal. I better get to the equipment room before launching into space. Who knows what kind of trouble I’ll run into?
31010
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nInto Rheinland?! I know I owe Lord Hakkera a lot, but there’s no way I’m going into the lion’s den! I’ve already been shot at enough for three lifetimes. There’s no way I’m going to the place where they all come from. Well, I suppose if it’s gotta be done it’s gotta be done, but why is it always me that has to do it? Maybe I’ll change my mind later. For now, I’m just going to take it easy for a while.
31015
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLord Hakkera was good enough to escort me to Sigma-13, along with a full honor guard. He’s got a new second command, Cobo. Good enough kid — young though. Ozu, I didn’t know him that long, but at least he went down fighting. I hope he’s happier wherever he is. In any case, I better get my head out of the clouds and back in the cockpit. Rumor has it that Rheinland has begun amassing ships in this system in preparation for war. Part of the reason I’m even getting an honor guard is so they can strike them before they get the chance to gain a foothold. Remarkable, even though they’re outcasts from Kusari society, the Blood Dragons still defend their home.
31020
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nInsane. That’s all that was. I’ve always heard about the legendary Blood Dragon pilots, and I even got to fly with them at Tekagi’s Arch, but I’ve never seen anything like Tekagi’s Honor. Not only did they fend off the fleet, but they also took down one of those monstrous Rheinland battleships! I wish I could have stayed to help, but Rheinland was only a short flight away. We had to fly through this old, abandoned graveyard of ships left over from the Eighty Years’ War. Eerie. I hope getting Von Claussen will prevent more of these from showing up.
31025
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWho were those two idiots? I’ve never been so creeped out in my life, and after that bit with Tekagi, I thought I was prepared for anything. Well, at least it gave me a lead. Why is it whenever I’m told to meet someone somewhere, they’re never there? It just makes things harder. Well, I’ll say one thing about New Berlin — they’ve got a pretty well-stocked bar. I’ll have to remember to come back one day if all this madness ever calms down.
31030
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt seems Herr Von Claussen’s intelligence networks are more extensive than I thought. He had this man, Hans Fischer, accompany me to Holstein. Good thing, too. Somehow, I doubt that Rheinland would have appreciated a wanted man wandering through their systems. The military buildup here is immense — like nothing I’ve ever seen. The war is really going to happen. For the first time, I have to say I’m a little scared. Still, it’d be nice to have at least a few credits in the bank for later in life, assuming there is a later in life.
31035
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nNow I remember, Herr Von Claussen. Ace pilot and tactician of the Rheinland Military — over 500 kills and he never lost an escort or wingman. I remember reading stories about him, but never in a million years did I think I’d ever be flying with him. I’m actually rather surprised he defected. I always thought he fought for his country, but I guess some things go beyond country and homeland. In any case, he wants to meet up with a Rheinland rebel group located not too far from here, and who am I to say no?
31040
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThankfully, Rheinland has spread itself so thin that it can’t properly maintain its local patrols. That little scuffle on the way in could have been worse. Von Claussen’s intelligence networks have managed to pull up data on the amassing of a secret fleet not too far from here. Finally, after weeks of getting chased around by these Rheinlanders, I get to hit ’em where it hurts. I really can’t wait. Better go stock up — it’s payback time.
31045
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOnly Von Claussen and I made it — the rest all died. It was a massacre … Capital ships everywhere … Botzler’s wing didn’t know what to do. They weren’t as experienced as Von Claussen or Botzler, and they weren’t nearly as skilled as Hakkera’s Honor Guard. They died protecting a home they’ll never see again. Botzler did it all. He took out the entire dry dock by himself. So many people have died. Then, to add insult to injury, the flagship of the South Rheinland Fleet decloaked right in front of our noses! Thankfully, Hakkera showed up out of nowhere in this ship I’d never seen before. Far be it from me to look a gift horse in the mouth. Turns out it’s owned by The Order and commanded by Orillion. Quite an impressive man, and a far stretch from that idiot Lonnigan they accused as being Orillion. We don’t have a lot of time left, and now that Von Claussen is safe and sound, I think I’ll treat myself to a drink. Where is the bar in this place anyway?
31100
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s ironic that after washing ashore in Liberty after Freeport 7 was destroyed, now so much later — I am going back. This time it’s not the cozy Manhattan bar, it’s the darkest hole Liberty has to offer. But we have a mission now — we are to save the President. Again, very ironic since she is the reason we’ve been hunted from the start. Well, that’s just another ironic twist of fate and this is where it all comes together. It’s not about money, it’s not about the Artifact. The stakes are higher now and I’ve got a job to do.
31105
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI can’t believe I’m back here in New York — and with Walker no less. What the hell did he have to do to stay alive? It’s unbelievable! So much has happened since the last time we worked together. Didn’t he once say something about fighting for a cause? Okay, here I am. Let’s get to it.
31110
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAn intra-system Jump Hole — what a ride! Taking out the satellite wasn’t too much of a problem, but Liberty has definitely increased its security from the last time I was here. The entrance to Zone 21 was a little more difficult. I can’t say I didn’t expect that. But we’ve come this far, we’re committed. Orillion’s last words concern me though, “Rescue or terminate.” Does this mean we may have to execute the President if she’s too far gone? I don’t know how to react to that yet. Whatever. It looks like we’re going to get the president — one way or another.
31115
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI can’t even comment on what I have been a witness to. The President is fine — meaning she is still human — and we have her now. I saw it — I saw what was inside the Chancellor. It was horrible. I hesitated; I admit it. It was all so far-fetched until I saw it for myself — right there in the prison cell. I saw it. I saw true evil. I won’t hesitate again.
31120
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOzu was a brave man. For a long time, I thought I could have saved him. No, I couldn’t. Ozu died doing what he had to. What I saw today drove this home: Walker and his entire crew sacrificed themselves so we could get the President back to the Osiris. I couldn’t have helped him any more than I could have helped Ozu. As Hakkera said, he knew the risks. I am thankful for Walker’s bravery and, briefly, his comradeship. We would not have made it without him and his crew.
31200
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI should have stayed on Leeds. Now they want me to fly into some Nomad base that will more than likely require me getting shot up by various ships I’ve never seen before. Once I get there, I have to tractor in some power cell to activate the stupid purple rock and then get out before it does something silly like explode. Excellent. Orillion says that the structure is more than likely abandoned. After everything that’s happened, I’ll be really surprised if it actually is.
31205
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s beautiful. It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. Still, we’ve got to hurry. I’ll have a better chance against those Nomad fighters than I will against the radiation in here.
31210
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThey were everywhere. Absolutely everywhere I turned, Nomads. Even after escaping the Lair, we jumped right into a fire fight. It all keeps getting crazier and crazier, and I have to force myself to believe that this is real. Von Claussen came out of nowhere like some avenging angel of death. I’ve never seen anyone pilot so coldly, and so efficiently. In any case, we’ve got to get back to Toledo so Quintaine can hook this power cell up and we can finally see what the Artifact can do.
31300
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSo the Artifact turns out to be a giant system map?! I have one of those on my ship!! Good for nothing, bald-headed windbag! Maybe I’m missing something. In any case, this base is incredibly impressive — the best ships and the best weapons I’ve ever seen. I’m getting that sinking feeling in my stomach about all of this. Like this is the ride into the sunset the hero makes, or maybe that heroic last stand. In any case, I’m taking up Orillion’s offer and stocking up on all the weapons and equipment I can.
31305
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSeems like that Hole that got sealed up to Omicron Beta only slowed them down. The Nomads bombed the base into ashes. Orillion had called us down to pick up the Artifact. This thing is supposed to stop all those damn blue bastards floating around in space right now. It’s like a boiling cauldron of lasers and ships out there, and we’re going right back into it.
31310
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThose Nomad battleships were a lot easier to take down when they were in dry dock. Things are getting hot now, and we’re heading straight into the demon’s maw. I’m tired. I’m tired of running away. I’m tired of being chased. It’s time to end all of this. I’m taking this stupid purple rock and shoving it straight down their throats.
31315
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’ll give them one thing, they don’t build things small. As big as the Jump Gate was that brought us here, this, this thing is even bigger. Quintaine called it a Dyson’s Sphere. Now we just have to find a way inside. Everyone in this fight owes the Nomads something. Revenge or a cry for freedom. No matter what, we’ve got to win. When did I get so damned patriotic? Must be all this space bacteria I keep seeing.
31320
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOh my god. It’s amazing. I have to take out those generators. There’s a shield around a city the size of a small planet! If we can get that shield down, I can shove this tinker toy right into their stomachs.
31325
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe managed to make it out of there after all. The Nomads all got sucked away into some kind of wormhole above the Nomad City. Orillion and The Order intend on keeping a close eye on it. They’ve even asked me to be their contact in Liberty. Hakkera has gone back to Kusari to rebuild. Tobias ended up getting kicked out of the Bretonia Royal Space Force just like I thought he would, but I think he got a girlfriend or something out of it. Von Claussen was nowhere to be found after the fight. He’s presumed dead, but somehow I doubt that. A man like Von Claussen doesn’t just fade away. President Jacobi gave Juni, King, and I a full pardon. We even got a medal … the Lone Star. Sounds kind of goofy, doesn’t it? Anyway, as much as I appreciate that, it doesn’t make up for the fact that I never got paid. Just my luck…. I’m a hero, but I’m back to freelancing. In the end, maybe that’s not all that bad. There are still lots of worlds to discover and systems to explore. I don’t think I’m ready to call Liberty home yet. A not insignificant reason for that is that I don’t think I’ll ever get used to Liberty Ale.

Famous Manhattan Artist Kidnapped
56001
MANHATTAN — In one of their boldest moves yet, the Liberty Rogues have kidnapped famous Sculptor John Frankel. He was discovered missing from his apartment two days ago. This afternoon, a ransom demand was received from his captors insisting that a million credits be left within the Pittsburgh Debris Field at a specific location, whereupon he would be released. Frankel’s family fears that the Rogues may kill him even if they do pay the ransom.
56002
Drug Abuse on the Rise in Liberty
56003
MANHATTAN — A recently conducted independent survey shows increased use of the illegal drug Cardamine by the young elite of Manhattan. “This is alarming news,” LPI chief, Bill Watkins, said as he responded to questions at a press conference that was called to specifically address the planet’s rising Cardamine infatuation. Watkins went on to say that LPI cannot and will not make exceptions for youngsters under the influence. “If we catch them with the drug, we have to put them away,” he later quoted after being questioned regarding the measures the LPI would take against young Manhattanites that were arrested for possession.
56004
Rheinland Expats Flock to Manhattan
56005
MANHATTAN — Rheinland high society is on the move, and Manhattan is the destination of choice. With the economic woes that Rheinland has been experiencing in recent years, many of the colony’s finest families are relocating to the center of Sirius. “I can live the life I wish to lead more easily here — it’s a shame, but true,” said Gerhardt Schliefner, a newcomer from Stuttgart. Immigrants most commonly cited the uncontrolled crime wave in Rheinland as their primary reason for leaving.
56006
Hazing Banned at West Point
56007
WEST POINT — The West Point command staff banned hazing today after the controversy stirred up last year involving the death of one of its newest recruits, Christine Belton. The youth died of alcohol poisoning during “hell week” at the academy’s most popular fraternity. “Christine shouldn’t have been drinking like that, since she was a small woman,” said cadet Josh Dawkins, a member of the fraternity, who was the first to report the incident to the staff at West Point.
56008
Record Bounty Offered by IC
56009
NEWARK — IC announced today a reward of two million credits for the death or capture of dreaded Outcast pirate Santiago Llorens. “IC is dedicated to the eradication of crime in Liberty and throughout Sirius,” said Public Relations Director John Vrimoot. Immediately the Bounty Hunters Guild issued a communication stating that two of its very finest men who have attained the rank of Guild Master would be dispatched with six journeymen Hunters to find and kill Llorens.
56010
Xeno Attack Repulsed by the LPI
56011
DETROIT — The Liberty outlaws known as the Xenos were routed after a brief firefight with LPI fighters today after they attempted to hijack an armored transport leaving the Detroit Munitions facility. The authorities were tipped off about the impending attack on the weapons shipment and laid a trap, which resulted in the capture of three outlaws and the death of three others. “The alert citizens of Liberty enabled us to strike a blow for justice today,” LPI representatives stated in a press conference.
56012
Corruption in the LPI
56013
FT. BUSH — A sting operation perpetrated by Free Eagle Press caught two LPI pilots taking bribes from a well-known Junker believed to be a primary smuggler within New York. The two officers were arrested today, a week after the video was aired. Although both officers entered “not guilty” pleas, the evidence against them is very strong. Both men’s faces clearly appear in the exchange caught on camera. “If they get sent to Texas, they are dead men,” said LPI Officer Susan Davies. “Cops who go to prison don’t come out.”
56014
The Badlands, Not Just a Name
56015
NEW YORK — Tucked into the southern end of New York lies the fields known as the Badlands. In a study conducted by IC, it was discovered that the Badlands is actually the most dangerous area in all of Liberty space. Populated by a variety of dangerous criminals, the field claims hundreds of lives per year. “I don’t go in there; that’s a military job,” said LPI officer Mary Dennis. It seems that even the military and the LSF have their troubles in the Badlands. IC recommends that civilians give the area a wide berth.
56016
Hacker Wins LA Surf Competition
56017
LOS ANGELES — Apparently, piracy isn’t the only thing that Lane Hackers are good at. This year the California Cup was won by none other than Gilbert Hudson, former Ageira employee and Lane Hacker. Hudson, who entered the competition under a false name, was identified by a former Ageira co-worker, who recognized him as he took center stage to accept the cup. As soon as Hudson saw LPI security guards making their way through the crowd towards the stage, he grabbed the cup and fired a message from a wrist transmitter. A moment later a ship descended from the skies. Hudson hopped aboard and fled with several police cruisers in hot pursuit.
56018
Nouveau Riche in California
56019
LOS ANGELES — The Liberty elite have traditionally lived in Manhattan, although the surge in recent California transplants may signal a new trend. In this month’s survey in Liberty Style, the superior climate and the presence of Ageira’s research facility on Los Angeles were noted as key factors for relocating New Yorkers. “This is the place to be rich if you are young,” quoted one 29-year-old Ageira executive.
56020
California Minor: Fact or Fantasy?
56021
CALIFORNIA — With California’s booming population growth many are wondering if Planetform will be able to deliver on the promises of California Minor. The company has assured the public that the planet will be finished within the next two generations. The future prosperity of Los Angeles may depend on that promise. “When my grandfather came here, he said there was a lot of wide-open space and plentiful water; now look at it — we’re jam-packed here,” said California Tourism Director Mike Greeley. “People see how great it is to come here, and they decide to stay. That can’t go on forever.”
56022
Workers Protest Monitoring Device
56023
LOS ANGELES — Ageira employees are threatening to strike after management’s last request that every employee be fitted with a location transmitter. It would be inserted under the skin as a permanent fixture, which would allow Ageira to monitor the location of its workers at all times. The device was proposed to combat the chance that any more Ageira staff would join the Lane Hackers if they decided to leave the company. “If their intentions are innocent, then no one should have a problem getting the chip,” reported an Ageira area director for operations in California.
56024
Outcasts Active in California
56025
MOJAVE — The Outcasts are the scourge of Sirius and have now emerged as the most pressing security problem in California. No shipping convoy or transport is safe from the drug-smuggling mask breathers who call themselves Outcasts. They have attacked yet again; this time it was Gold shipments inbound from Bretonia. IC contends that the attack was premeditated and that the Outcasts had inside information regarding the convoy’s cargo manifests. This is a tell-tale sign of Lane Hacker involvement. The cooperation between these two criminal groups can only spell more trouble for the people of this system.
56026
Planetform Demands More Money
56027
CALIFORNIA MINOR — California Minor is costing more than first expected to terraform. Or at least this is what Planetform claimed today as they again lobbied for additional funds from the Liberty government and other investors. The company claims that the process is on schedule, but there have been extra expenses due to the difficult terrain encountered on the planet’s surface. Manhattan sources speculate that Liberty will deny any further funding requests made before the project’s targeted completion date of 845 AS.
56028
Yukon Will Return to New York
56029
BATTLESHIP YUKON — The battleship Yukon needs repairs and maintenance. The ship will soon be on its way to the Norfolk Shipyards for refitting and rearming. The LPI states that this maintenance will not leave the system vulnerable to attack from outlaws because the security contingent in California will be tripled during the estimated six-month hiatus. “It’s time the old girl had a paint job,” quipped Yukon’s chief engineer, George Stuart. Although the Yukon will need quite a bit more than a new coat of paint, military officials say that this is no more than routine maintenance.
56030
Two Marauder Players Slain in Attack
56031
SAN DIEGO — Kevin Kincaid and Reginald Burney were both killed when their luxury transport ship was attacked and destroyed by Outcasts while on its way through the system. These exceptional players will be sorely missed as the California Marauders try to make their way through the playoffs. The team has been given a bye week to recruit replacements from the waivers or with free agents. Memorial services will be held for both men next week after the upcoming match against Cambridge.
56032
Undesirables Still Lurking in the Hills
56033
DENVER — It looks like the LPI might still have work left to do on the planet. A large group of vagrants and squatters have been repeatedly sighted in Lowell Park, one of the most mountainous regions in the northern hemisphere of the planet. The LPI is planning a large raid of the area to clear out any who do not have the right to be there. “We are going to boot these troublemakers off Denver, don’t worry,” said Denver LPI Chief Sheri Henson.
56034
Garbled Messages Baffle Authorities
56035
DENVER — LPI investigators are puzzled today as they wrestle with the third encrypted message that has been intercepted in as many weeks. The transmissions are coming from multiple locations within the northern Colorado asteroid fields. Frustrated by the LPI’s failure to make headway in the investigation, Ageira has loaned their top encryption specialists to aid the police effort. One source theorized that the transmissions are using a modified Ageira encryption algorithm, which suggests Lane Hacker involvement.
56036
Klugh to Give Benefit Concert
56037
DENVER — Popular Manhattan musician and singer “G-Klu” will be playing at the Johnson Amphitheater tonight in a one-time benefit show. The proceeds of the concert are going to be donated in their entirety to the “Help the Children of Denver Fund,” which is an organization dedicated to assisting orphaned children from around Colorado find homes with wealthy families on the planet. At five thousand credits each, the tickets were not exactly a bargain. Nevertheless, they quickly sold out. Expect to see the best that Colorado society has to offer at the show.
56038
Hackers Tangle with Xenos
56039
GUNNISON — A Liberty Navy patrol stumbled upon a skirmish between Lane Hackers and Xenos in the Alamosa Field. “It was pretty obvious that the Hackers were winning the scrap, Xenos were blowing up left and right,” reported Navy captain Alison Chamberlain. The Navy patrol entered the fray to find themselves being fired upon by both sides. “One minute they were killing each other, then both groups were raining shots down on us,” Chamberlain added. More Navy ships arrived shortly and the remaining pirates retreated.
56040
Bowex and Gateway Trade Shots
56041
SILVERTON FIELD — Bowex and Gateway transports exchanged fire near the Trade Lanes leading from Pueblo to the New York Gate. The rivalry between the two Bretonian firms has always been a bitter one, but this is the first documented incident of hostile action occurring within a House system. The captains of the two ships claim that the guns were activated “accidentally” and it was not their intention to hurt anyone. Indeed, no damage occurred to either vessel since the shields absorbed the few shots that were fired.
56042
Skirmish in Rio Grande Bar Injures Five
56043
RIO GRANDE — A scuffle broke out aboard the Battleship Rio Grande three days ago between Navy crewmen and several Bounty Hunters. Apparently, the exchange began when one of the Bounty Hunters made a negative comment regarding the condition of the Liberty battleship and the poor quality of the patrol craft that Navy pilots fly. The argument escalated when several punches were thrown. Soon, the ship’s bar had degenerated into an all-out brawl. Five were treated at the battleship’s infirmary for various minor injuries.
56044
Liberty Ship Destroyed in Collision
56045
GALILEO JUMP GATE — Samura offered an official apology today to the families of the men lost aboard a small Synth Luxury Foods Freighter that was headed towards New Tokyo. The Samura employee who was piloting the larger vessel claims that his ship had right of way to enter the trade lanes, but the Synth vessel exiting the lanes ignored his ship and recklessly attempted to sweep by the freight train. Many are suspicious of this claim but no one has any proof to the otherwise since there were no other witnesses.
56046
Squatters Appeal to Government
56047
DENVER — A coalition of impoverished Colorado residents made an appeal to the Liberty government today, presenting a message entitled: “Being poor is not illegal.” The prepared statement was addressed to the legislature in Manhattan and summarized a list of the grievances that many long-time Colorado residents held. They cited numerous examples of revised zoning laws that forced them to abandon their homes for temporary encampments scattered in the hills. There they faced harassment by LPI “squatter” patrols. There’s been no official acknowledgment from New York.
56048
Crime in the Family
56049
HOUSTON — A recent poll showed that more than 80 percent of the entire population of Houston has a family member that has been convicted of a crime or has served time on an LPI station. However, only 30 percent of all those employed in the Fertilizer or Construction machinery plants have been convicted of a felony offense. For many, it seems that working the plants is their only chance at leading a legitimate life.
56050
A Debt is Owed to Texas
56051
HOUSTON — Before the Dallas Incident, Liberty invested heavily in Texas. Houston residents were led to believe that the system would be the research center of the entire House. Virtually overnight the government moved out, leaving nothing but destruction and decay in its wake. Many citizens feel that the government had no right to leave Texas so abruptly because of a terrible government error. “There wouldn’t be no crime here if they gave folks an option,” says Fertilizer plant worker and Houston native Frank Stalls. Perhaps there is a better alternative to solving crime than building new prisons.
56052
Houston Resident Recovers Loot
56053
HOUSTON — Horace Whittaker was awakened last week to the sound of a terrific explosion outside his home. A smoking crater was all that remained of his backyard and a Liberty Rogue ship that had plummeted from the skies. The next day, as Whittaker surveyed the wreckage, he spotted something shining in the ashes. It turned out to be a Diamond. “I started digging through that mess like crazy,” Whittaker reported. When all was told, he had recovered over a million credits in Diamonds. According to Liberty law, the Diamonds are his.
56054
The Guild is Looking for New Blood
56055
HOUSTON — They say the best way to catch a criminal is to hire one, and that is exactly what the Bounty Hunters Guild is doing in the following months. Guild masters will be coming in from New York to recruit new Bounty Hunters into the organization. For many, this is an excellent opportunity to leave Texas and make their fortunes adventuring in space. Any applicants who qualify will receive training and benefits, although all pay is earned exclusively through successful bounty collections.
56056
Prisoner Dies in Escape Attempt
56057
HUNTSVILLE — Liberty Rogue Jerry Bender died yesterday when he suffocated inside the Consumer Goods container he was trying to escape in. The brigand was able to sneak into the container of Textiles being shipped to New York, but he did not account for the oxygen that he would need to survive the journey. His container was loaded aboard an express transport bound for Manhattan, but a backup at the New York Gate caused the shipment to arrive 2 hours too late for the unfortunate escapee.
56058
Outcasts on the Prowl in Texas
56059
SUGARLAND — It is believed that the Outcasts’ most recent assault on an LPI transport bound for Manhattan was a revenge attack for the recent death of Outcast bandit Jorge Garcia. Garcia had been serving time aboard the Sugarland for Cardamine smuggling and piracy when he died unexpectedly of natural causes. The transport was attacked by a large sortie of Outcast ships from the North Dallas Debris Field as it made its way along the Trade Lanes. Three LPI escorts and the transport itself were destroyed in the attack. The Outcasts escaped behind the marker buoys and into the debris before more LPI forces could arrive.
56060
Xeno Prison Populations Growing
56061
HUNTSVILLE — Soon a Xeno leader will finish his sentence aboard the Huntsville and likely rejoin his partners in crime. Figures show that for every Xeno that enters the Texas prison system, three more exit. Apparently, the Xenos are using the LPI stations as prime recruiting grounds for their war against foreign shippers. This criminal group is currently the fastest-growing illegal faction within Liberty. If this trend continues, Xenos will outnumber Rogues in fifteen years.
56062
Rheinland Critical of Liberty Navy
56063
HOUSTON — According to New Berlin, the crew aboard the battleship Mississippi is not doing an adequate job of protecting Rheinland ships passing through Texas. This statement was made after Republican Shipping lodged a complaint with the Rheinland government concerning the number of convoys that have fallen victim to Xenos, Rogues, and Outcasts in the system. Liberty asserts that its own ships are offered even less protection in the Hamburg system.
56064
Chancellor Condemns New Berlin Lifestyle
56065
NEW BERLIN — The Chancellor sharply criticized the black markets and cabarets that have become commonplace on New Berlin. “We must learn to live wholesome lives even in times of economic uncertainty and civil strife,” he stated in the televised speech delivered yesterday. Many interpreted it as an attempt to address the planet’s rapidly rising Cardamine problem, blamed by some on the Junkers.
56066
Today is Emperor Pausbeck’s Day
56067
NEW BERLIN — This Pausbeck’s Day is of special significance because it marks the 500th anniversary of the disaster that destroyed Mülheim. After spending millions to outfit the Ring with mirrors in the hopes of reflecting the sun’s energy onto the dark side of New Berlin, Emperor Pausbeck’s contraption fired a beam that was effectively an orbital laser strike on the city of Mülheim. Every year since it has become a tradition to do something foolish for Pausbeck’s Day, so what are you going to do?
56068
Fists Fly at Reichstag During Debate
56069
NEW BERLIN — A fight broke out in the Reichstag Wednesday between Dresden and Hamburg representatives during debates over a resolution that Hamburg delegates brought to the floor. The resolution would force Dresden civilians to pay extra taxes to cover the costs of repairing damage to government facilities caused by Red Hessians. Representative Lukas of Dresden was arguing with Hamburg representative Fleischer when the dispute suddenly escalated; “Lukas screamed that the Hessians were Daumann’s problem, not the fault of the people of Dresden; then he picked up his chair, and hit Fleischer with it,” said Rep. Weiss of New Berlin. “A moment later there was mayhem.”
56070
Daumann Introduces New Weapon
56071
THE RING — Daumann’s weapons Research and Development Division announced that it had created a new Side Arm that would compete with the ever-popular Detroit Perforator. The new weapon will be called the Daumann Shredder, capable of firing extremely high-velocity splinters made of depleted Uranium. The thousands of projectiles contained in a typical burst have been shredding targets in Daumann tests.
56072
More LWB Attacks
56073
DORTMUND — The LWB managed to destroy another Paste convoy as it approached the Hamburg Jump Gate yesterday. The terrorists attacked the convoy from the Ruhrfeld, a notorious hiding place for criminals. Synth Foods is demanding that the Rheinland security forces send a ship into the old mining area to eliminate the criminal element within. Rheinland responded in an official release, stating that military and police budgets were stretched to the limit and that all of its forces were already deployed in other areas.
56074
Blue Diamonds: Red Hot Fashion
56075
DRESDEN — The blue Diamonds mined at Krüger’s Bautzen facility in Dresden have recently gained in popularity among the Rheinland super-rich. More top designers and jewelers are using the expensive rocks that have come to be known as Hessian Tears. Rebecca Daumann, daughter of the current CEO of the mega-corporation, is in many ways responsible for the stone’s resurgence. She has been wearing them to all the largest galas and parties thrown in New Berlin, and her flawless fashion sense has captured the public’s imagination.
56076
Junkers: Too much Trash?
56077
KREUZBERG — The scavengers of Sirius who make their home in New Berlin are complaining that just because they are called Junkers doesn’t mean that they will take anything. “People are bringing us their garbage and expecting us to trade for it,” Otto Schumann reported. Apparently, Rheinland’s economic woes are affecting everyone, even the criminals. “I can’t sell it to ALG like Scrap Metal, and these people are expecting me to trade them Food and Consumer Goods for it,” Schumann later added.
56078
Bombs Destroy Republican Convoy
56079
HAMBURG — Republican lifter vehicles were filling the hold of the RSV Vonkar when an explosion ripped through the ship’s hull, showering flaming debris in all directions. Moments later, two more bombs went off aboard the recently loaded RSV Valkyrie and Peter Schultz. More than one hundred seventy Republican employees were killed. Republican Shipping’s standard practice of unloading foreign vessels and ferrying imported commodities through Rheinland space is now being questioned by those inside the company, sources reveal. Investigators claim that the bombs were most likely planted in cargo containers aboard ships in Liberty. Unioners have claimed responsibility for the bombing.
56080
Drug Ring Uncovered in Docks
56081
HAMBURG — Dock loaders employed by Republican Shipping, working in the East Hamburg launch piers were detained yesterday and charged with distributing Cardamine. Republican claims that these men are Unioner operatives working to undermine the image of Republican Shipping. “The crimes that these men committed were reprehensible, and in no way represents the morality of other hard-working Republican employees. We only hope that these criminals will be punished to the fullest extent of the law,” a Republican spokesperson was quoted saying.
56082
Team Mascot Destroyed at Tourney
56083
HAMBURG — The Hamburg Plasmaball team mascot, Zuggie the Juggernaut, met a violent end in Hamburg’s playoff bout with the Colorado Eagles. Zuggie has been the Juggernaut’s mascot for over two centuries, and though he was an old robot, his popularity was tremendous. Apparently, an overzealous Eagle fan smuggled a Detroit Landblaster into the arena. During the halftime show, just as Zuggie was finishing his act, a rocket flew from the stands and destroyed him. Rheinland Federal Police quickly gunned down the Liberty fan before anyone else could be hurt.
56084
Racing Banned within City Limits
56085
HAMBURG — Twenty-three employees of the accounting firm Junger and Prowst were killed and scores injured tonight in what officials are calling the worst tragedy ever resulting from skiff racing in Hamburg City. Four skiffs were racing on the third elevation deck of the north quadrant when one of the pilots lost control and barreled into an H-Fuel-laden transport. The transport’s driver ejected just as the ship crashed into the thirty-fourth floor of Junger and Prowst’s main offices.
56086
Authorities Thwart Hessian Attack
56087
LÜBECK — Fighters were scrambled yesterday from the battleship Westfalen and Lübeck police base when reports came in of two Red Hessian squads near Altona. The military patrols encountered the Hessians first, north of the Südheide. The two squads were identified as the 3rd and 4th belonging to the Broken Pick Brigade. Half of the pirates broke off to engage the military patrol while the others continued westward. Police intercepted the second group near Hannover. After several minutes of intense fighting, the remaining Hessians fled.
56088
Professor Arrested for Terrorist Ties
56089
HAMBURG — Professor Heinrich Klein was detained Saturday evening on charges of illegally aiding the Bundschuh terrorist movement. A student of his alerted the police to his criminal ties shortly after midterm examinations. The student claims, “Klein tried to indoctrinate me in the Bundschuh philosophy during our talks after class.” While being an intellectual supporter of the organization is not illegal, police investigations revealed that Klein was laundering funds received from the sale of Bundschuh stolen goods.
56090
Twelve Killed in Prison Escape
56091
VIERLANDE — Four convicted Red Hessian pirates attempted an escape from the prison station Vierlande. The inmates overpowered a guard and took his access keys, making their way to the ship’s armory. After arming themselves they fought their way to an airlock, killing seven more guards. One guard who fought the Hessians said, “It seemed like they were waiting for somebody to come and pick them up, but no one ever did.” Out of ammunition and out of hope, the inmates blew the emergency hatch on the airlock in an unsuccessful attempt to decompress the deck. All four were sucked into the void.
56092
Celebrity Endorses Glitzy Cabaret
56093
HAMBURG — Erika Müller is opening a new cabaret in the heart of Hamburg’s industrial district. The famous singer will be performing to boost attendance for the grand opening of the cabaret named “The Bomb,” which is scheduled to open next week. Audiences are expected to come from throughout the system. Müller hasn’t made a personal appearance in over three years, having isolated herself from the public after the death of her husband, the late Captain Hans Müller of Lübeck Station. Captain Müller was thrust into the limelight after rescuing Erika’s ship from Red Hessians several years ago.
56094
Opinion Divided on Latest Tax Law

NEW BERLIN — The Rheinland government announced that the old tax codes are being thrown out and rewritten. “We are going to start from scratch,” an anonymous government source reported. Many of Rheinland’s citizens feel that the taxes imposed upon them are unfair in light of the economic turmoil facing the colony, and the Reichstag agrees. There are still skeptics out there, but who can blame them? “I’ve heard this all before,” one interviewee uttered. This will be the third time in four years that the tax code has been revised.

Farmers Singing the Blues
56097
STUTTGART — Independent farmers on Stuttgart have been sending complaints to New Berlin again. This time it’s not about swine or squeloms, but blue jillies. The native Stuttgart flower has had yet another bad growing season. The farmers contend that the culprit is the Synth Foods-sponsored CO2 enhancement project that began three decades ago. Synth Foods was not available for comment.

Fanning the Flames in Stuttgart
56099
STUTTGART — 50 Luxury resort condominiums in the city of Wertheim were destroyed last night in a spectacular blaze. Despite the timely response of the WVS, the villas were declared a total loss early this morning by fire marshal Herbert. Many locals are turning a narrow eye to the Liberty corporation Orbital Spa and Cruise Lines. The independent Rheinland-run resort was Orbital’s main competition in Stuttgart. The project’s owner, Johann Schneider, had this to say, “This tragedy comes just two weeks after I refused an Orbital offer to buy my property at below market value. It seems like too great a coincidence to be just bad luck.”

WVS Ejects LWB Sympathizers
56101
STUTTGART — A group of sixteen farmers from the Reichmann Plains chapter of the WVS was ejected from the organization after the discovery that they were funneling money to the LWB. WVS representative James Tomlinson said, “We can’t have our people supporting terrorists — it is just unethical.” The farmers thrown out of the growing association have made claims that the WVS is under Synth Foods’ control since the Rheinland government forced out the old board members.

Trouble in Paradise
56103
BADEN-BADEN — Orbital Spa and Cruise Line’s luxury liner Baden-Baden is posting record losses this quarter. Orbital representatives are blaming the declining Rheinland economy for the unexpected revenue shortfall. “We have resorts throughout Sirius, but Baden-Baden is the only unprofitable facility,” said Orbital’s Executive Vice President of Operations, Bill Johnson. To make up for the losses, there has been talk of shipping in Liberty economy-class tourists to the resort. Many Stuttgart citizens who believe that there is enough Liberty presence in the system already picketed the Orbital office on Monday.
56104
Famous Hessian Spotted near Resort
56105
BADEN-BADEN — Red Hessian brigade commander Franz Steiner was spotted yesterday just east of Baden-Baden headed towards the Ostnebel. The shipping convoy’s captain, Ulrich Lumarcke, who spotted Steiner, said he breathed a sigh of relief when the infamous pirate, escorted by two other Hessians, kept flying right past his ship. “They must have had full holds because they didn’t even bother to scan me. I’m lucky they didn’t attack anyway — I’ve seen ’em do that.” Federal Police were alerted, but by the time they arrived in the area, Steiner and his wingmen had disappeared.
56106
Daumann Family Targeted in Raid
56107
STUTTGART — Two luxury-class transports headed to Baden-Baden with New Berlin’s social elite were attacked and destroyed Monday by half of a Red Hessian brigade. There were no survivors of the disaster. “This was a planned strike,” Federal Police Captain Roland Bals admitted to the press. The Daumann family members aboard one of the destroyed transports were presumed to be the primary target of the vicious attack.
56108
Two Killed in Furgen Ranch Blast
56109
STUTTGART — Independent Rheinland beef rancher Karl Furgen, who was supposedly killed several months ago, might still be alive. Synth Foods employees say that they recognized him as he was boarding an escape vessel after trespassing on his property, which Synth Foods recently seized. Moments after his ship took off, a bomb ripped through the center of the ranch’s main buildings. Two Synth Foods employees were killed in the blast, and three more have been hospitalized.
56110
Diamond Shipment Attacked
56111
DRESDEN — The Trade Lane between the New Berlin Jump Gate and the Krüger Minerals station Bautzen was the site of a major Red Hessian attack yesterday. Security was especially tight, but the Red Hessians knew it was coming and hit hard. Krüger, anticipating a possible ambush, had hired several Freelancers and Bounty Hunters to protect the Diamond shipment. Luckily, these precautions paid off, and the convoy made it safely to New Berlin.
56112
GMG No Longer a Threat
56113
FRANKFURT — It looks like the GMG probes into the Frankfurt system might finally be a thing of the past. Since the end of the Eighty Years’ War, the GMG has periodically launched raids against the Krüger-owned Mannheim H-Fuel facility. The Fulda Border Station has reported no GMG activity during the last several years. Although this is good news for Frankfurt, it is unlikely that many people will ever populate the nearly deserted system.
56114
Synth Foods Convoys Collide
56115
STUTTGART — In its most daring attack to date, the LWB attacked two Synth Foods convoys traveling in opposite directions along the Trade Lanes between the New Berlin Jump Gate and Planet Stuttgart. “Next thing you know we’ve got four inbound missiles headed right for us,” said one of the transport gunners, Karl Gruber. Both ships dropped out of the Lanes to find themselves surrounded by the largest LWB force yet assembled. The momentum of the fast-moving transports in the Trade Lanes caused several ships to collide before they could undertake evasive maneuvers. This is a well-known Hessian tactic that the LWB has apparently adopted.
56116
Museum Opens New Exhibit
56117
NEW LONDON — The National History Archives in association with the Royal Bretonian Historical Society has created a new exhibit focused on raising the New Londonite’s awareness of growth and development on the planet over the past eight centuries. Archive photos will be on display from as far back as the Bretonia Sleeper Ship’s scouting surveys of the planet’s surface before colonization. From the rolling hills of violet grasses that covered the planet’s landscapes, to the construction of the Southampton Shipyards, the exhibit will present all who visit a chance to look upon our past.
56118
Planet Wide Clean-Up Proposed
56119
NEW LONDON — Green Front-backed Representatives in Parliament have put forward a resolution to initiate a massive clean-up of New London. The representatives focused upon the improvement of the quality of life that New Londonite’s currently lead. “I can’t go outside in the rain because prolonged exposure to the acidic water can cause health problems,” said Terence Wimberley, one of the writers of the resolution. The piece of legislation, if it passes in parliament, will be the most ambitious project yet undertaken to reverse the effects of New London’s accelerated industrialization.
56120
Son of Aristocrat Arrested
56121
NORTH SOMERSET — Nathaniel Carrington, son of Lord Phillip Carrington, will be spending some time in the Fuller Rehabilitation Facilities after his arrest for the possession of Cardamine. Nathaniel was stopped by a police patrol last Wednesday in north Somerset when they witnessed his skiff collide with a light pole. “I was worried for the safety of the lads in the speeder,” Constable Cochrane said when he realized who he had arrested. The Cardamine found in the skiff was enough to earn Nathaniel a four-year sentence, but the judge reduced it to six months rehabilitation since it was Carrington’s first offense.
56122
Famous Bounty Hunter Dies
56123
SHROPSHIRE — Emma Harris, one of Bretonia’s most successful Bounty Hunters, passed away at her estate on Sunday evening. From humble beginnings, Harris became renowned for her incredible skill as a pilot, including her daring tactics. She was catapulted to fame when she killed five Mollys single-handedly and captured one of their top leaders, Seamus O’Riordan. Harris amassed great personal wealth from hunting and retired at the age of 57. Never one to sit still, Harris began a crusade against what she called “the social bigotry of our society.”
56124
Bretonia’s Greatest Threat
56125
KENSINGTON — Ever since the Corsairs arrived in Bretonian space, they have brought nothing with them but crime, murder, and piracy. Their recent infestation in this system has caused untold death and destruction in the formerly peaceful colony of Bretonia. Corsair murders often lack any clear motive, unlike the political assassinations that are the trademark of the Mollys. Corsairs are motivated by simple greed, with a startling lack of compassion for human life. The scourge of southern Sirius often carries Alien Artifacts. If your ship is attacked by Corsairs, your best option is to drop any valuables you have and head towards the nearest Police Authority post as quickly as possible.
56126
BMM Executive Meets Violent End
56127
THAMES — Quincy Pierce, Executive Vice President of Labor Relations for BMM and father of two, was found dead on Thursday. Molly assassins penetrated security at Thames Outpost late Wednesday night and made their way to Pierce’s office. The VP was often known to work late, and the Mollys used this information to strike. They killed him with a blow to the head by a pickaxe that was left in the office. The murderers also left some fools’ gold, the Mollys infamous and gruesome calling card, in the executive’s pocket.
56128
Five Killed in Canterbury Attack
56129
CANTERBURY — Planetform’s New London base, Canterbury, was the victim of a small raid by Gaians yesterday. The station itself suffered minimal damage, but an inbound personnel transport was destroyed as it attempted to dock. Bounty Hunters at the station scrambled immediately and pursued the three Gaian ships as they fled. The five killed were low-level Planetform employees, so the attack was likely nothing more than a random strike. This marks the fifth Gaian strike in the last month. Authorities are concerned that the eco-terrorist threat could be growing.
56130
The Queen Celebrates Her Birthday
56131
NEW LONDON — Our Royal Highness will be enjoying her 37th birthday next month, and preparations are underway for a gala of spectacular proportions to celebrate the grand event. New London society is busy preparing itself for the grand occasion; clothiers, jewelers, and goldsmiths are backlogged with orders. Socialites from all over Bretonia have already made arrangements to visit the capital for the affair, making it nearly impossible to find decent lodgings. The Queen says that she wishes the festivities to be elegant but simple, but it looks like her admirers have another idea.
56132
Hackers Avoid Capture Yet Again
56133
KINGSTON — Two days ago the Lane Hackers seized a Bowex Gold shipment headed for Liberty space and disappeared before authorities could get to them. The Hackers are known for their advanced technology that allows them to strike with stunning accuracy at the most valuable ship convoys. This attack was no different. IC is posting mammoth rewards for the live capture of any Lane Hacker, and many Bounty Hunters are getting ready to try and collect. As of yet, the well-financed pirate organization has been too slippery to let one of its own be captured alive.
56134
Outcast Plague Blamed on Liberty
56135
SHEFFIELD STATION — A recent study funded by Bowex has shown that the majority of Outcasts that travel through Bretonia are trying to pass through to Liberty, where they sell their narcotic Cardamine into the black markets. “The damage they do here is circumstantial. They are criminals, so they have no qualms about piracy, but nothing is drawing them to Bretonia in particular, except the path to Liberty,” researcher Alistair Jordan stated in a special press conference held on the station. Unfortunately, these findings do not diminish the effect that Outcasts have had in Manchester.
56136
BMM Transport Slams into Asteroid
56137
BIRMINGHAM — Traffic along the Trade Lanes between Birmingham Station and the Cortez Jump Gate came to a halt Thursday when a very large ice asteroid drifted into the Lane. The BMM Freighter Clayton was destroyed when it collided with the itinerant chunk of ice while traveling at high speed. Police vessels from Kingston responded promptly, and the Lane was shut down until the asteroid could be cleared. The delay backed up ships on the vital Bretonia to Liberty commercial route for several hours. BMM later lodged an official complaint with the police for failure to maintain the safety of this passage.
56138
Annual Sheffield Festival a Success
56139
SHEFFIELD — The Interstellar Beer and Ale Festival held each year at Sheffield was once again a huge success, with only two deaths and 22 injuries reported during the four-day festival. William Cartwright and James McFee were both killed in deathmatch keg-stand competitions, while several others were injured. The majority of injuries came from the enormous brawls that occur during the height of the festival. Rheinland’s XXX Nova Bock took first prize from the judges this year.
56140
Another Prison in Manchester?
56141
MANCHESTER — It looks like there may be a need to build another prison facility in addition to the infamous Newgate Prison in Manchester. Planners are just speculating right now, but it is more than likely that if a second penitentiary is added, it will be built adjacent to the first national prison station. The belief is that it will be more efficient to protect the two facilities if they are close to each other. Projections show that the Newgate population will be at twice its intended capacity within ten years if current trends hold.
56142
Record Wheat Harvest
56143
CAMBRIDGE — The Cambridge Regents were proud to announce today that the crop yield for wheat was twenty percent greater than last year’s. Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences (RAAS) Chairholder Walter Bunbury attributes the bumper crop to a new farming technique that was recently developed at Cambridge University’s School of Agrarian Sciences. “We are very excited about this breakthrough, and look forward to selling this new technology to other farming operations throughout Sirius,” said Bunbury, who announced the good news on behalf of the Regents.
56144
Alien Artifacts to Stay in Cambridge
56145
CAMBRIDGE — University of Cambridge’s Head of Xenoarchaeology, Anne Dixon, petitioned the Board of Regents to reject the Crown’s decree that requires the confiscation of all Alien Artifacts by the government. The board accepted the professor’s proposal and issued a statement insisting that Alien Artifacts under the university’s control be left in the hands of scientific research. “This decision by the Crown to follow Liberty’s mandate without question is disturbing news to us,” said Dixon’s aid, Gill Bellington.
56146
Regents Expel Corporate Recruiters
56147
CAMBRIDGE — Representatives from BMM and Planetform, Inc. are back on transports orbiting the planet after their expulsion from the University by the Cambridge Board of Regents. “Their presence here was a disruption to studies,” said Roger Tarrywell, who issued the order on behalf of the regents. When questioned about the possible link between the corporate visitors on the planet and the fire at the Green Front offices, Tarrywell offered no comment, other than to say, “I am not authorized to speak upon what can only be pure speculation.”
56148
Heroes of Norfolk Foil Corsairs
56149
NORFOLK — Bretonian military personnel won a battle today against evil when a naval patrol intercepted a flight of Corsairs headed south through the Keswick Ice Cloud. Though they were outnumbered and outgunned, Lt. William Longfield and Captain Jane Gilliam were able to destroy five Corsair ships, allowing only one to escape into the Grasmere Ice Cloud. Their valorous effort has been recognized in the halls of New London, and both pilots will be recognized next week for their heroic deeds.
56150
Cavaliers Victorious Over the Herons
56151
CAMBRIDGE FIELDS — Cambridge fans are still celebrating the defeat of the Hokkaido Herons two nights ago, which allows Cambridge to move ahead in the playoffs. Next week the team will face the Colorado Eagles to decide who will enter the Plasmaball Finals. The winner of this last match was originally slated to play California, but the recent loss of the Marauders’ center and stun forward has allowed the team a bye week as it scrambles to replace from waivers its fallen team members. The two athletes were killed when their luxury transport was attacked and destroyed by Outcast raiders.
56152
Green Front Office Destroyed in Fire
56153
CAMBRIDGE — Arson is suspected in a fire that claimed the lives of two Cambridge University students last night. The fire broke out late in the evening at the headquarters of The Green Front, a lobbying organization that represents Cambridge interests in New London. Located within walking distance of the Cambridge University, the Green Front is composed almost entirely of professors and volunteer students. Two student volunteers perished in the rapidly spreading blaze that took several hours for firefighters to bring under control. “Their loss is a terrible tragedy,” said Professor Willingham, who issued a statement this morning for the Green Front.
56154
Cambridge Line Scores Direct Hit
56155
NORFOLK — A Rheinland freighter was destroyed Saturday by a malfunctioning weapons platform along the Cambridge Line, a system-defense grid along the eastern side of the Trade Lanes leading to the planet. The RSV Heilbronn’s engine reactor was hit by a missile, causing the nuclear core to destabilize and explode. The Rheinland government and Republican Shipping demanded an explanation for the incident. The Crown responded with a statement of deep regret for the accident and sent its condolences to the grieving families of the crew. Aged wiring is believed to be the cause of the platform malfunction.
56156
A Constant Threat
56157
DUBLIN — The Mollys have issued a new warning for the Bretonian government. In this most recent message, the criminal organization stated that if Dublin wasn’t given over to Molly control and royal forces evacuated immediately, a major disaster would befall the Bretonian capital. Bretonian Defense Minister Jonathon Long downplayed the warning, “It will take more than empty threats and pilfered Gold to remove our presence from Dublin.”
56158
BMM Leaves a Bad Taste
56159
LEEDS — BMM came under fire last week when it was discovered that the free food distributed to employees working on the planet is of substandard quality, normally used as livestock feed on Cambridge. Workers were further enraged when they heard this comment from a BMM executive, “We never thought it was an issue since most of our planetside labor lost their ability to taste and smell after the first year or two on Leeds.”
56160
Massive Mineshaft Collapse Kills 192
56161
SETTLEMENT 483 — The honeycombed surface just south of Mining Settlement 483 collapsed yesterday in what is believed to be one of the worst mineshaft cave-ins in Leeds’ history. The residents of 483 were awakened near midnight by tremors and rumbling. “Next thing you know my entire living complex was falling. Most of my neighbors are dead,” a dazed Giles Chamberlain reported from his hospital bed. Investigators have cited over-mining in the area as the cause.
56162
BMM Pressured to Clean up Dump
56163
SETTLEMENT 9171 — The residents of Mining Settlement 9171 are lodging an official complaint with the Bretonian Government today. It was recently discovered that the newly established settlement is situated on a centuries-old toxic waste dump. Already there are reports of widespread sickness and some deaths. BMM built 9171 when it was discovered that there were previously unexploited copper deposits far below the surface. “The reason nobody did any digging around here was because of the toxic waste dump. BMM just figured they wouldn’t let that stop them anymore,” stated Brian Roberts, a resident of 9171.
56164
Mollys Captured Aboard LD-14
56165
LD-14 — The security screening process that an individual must go through to work at the LD-14 MOX processing facility is rigorous, but recent events have shown that these measures may still be inadequate. Two Molly operatives were captured Wednesday as they attempted to transmit coded messages from a long-range mobile communicator aboard LD-14. Under interrogation, the men reported that they had been coerced by Molly agents to transmit shipping schedules and cargo manifests. Both men have been detained on the battleship York until sentencing next week.
56166
Life Expectancy up in Leeds
56167
LEEDS — The Royal Census Bureau reported that the average life expectancy of a Leeds resident has improved since the last census was tallied 20 years ago. A female on the planet can expect to live 1.2 years longer on average. The number also increased for residents within the system, though less significantly, with a boost of 0.8 years. The Bureau attributes the better numbers to a stricter interpretation of the Laws of Labor Safety that were recently instituted by the Crown. The new average life span for a person on Leeds is 51, and for those in the system, 67.
56168
BMM has Eye on the Border Worlds
56169
STOKES — It is no secret that Leeds and the Stokes Field have almost been completely mined out. This is disturbing news for BMM officials who must begin to look elsewhere for the raw materials needed to fuel the Bretonian industry. BMM executives have already begun searching for new sources of material and have met with some success in the Border Worlds. “Unfortunately, these systems beyond the edge of Bretonian rule are very dangerous to operate in, therefore incurring far greater security costs,” said BMM representative Patrick Chamberlain.
56170
Fugitive Escapes Bounty Hunter Trap
56171
DURHAM — Ruthless murderer, pirate, and drug smuggler Santiago Llorens hijacked another Diamond shipment bound for Leeds from New London. This last attack was supposed to be his last according to the statements of the two Guild master Bounty Hunters contracted by IC to dispatch Llorens. It was the Hunters’ plan to lure the Outcast into a trap, but their strategy backfired when Santiago killed one of the guild masters and four of their support Hunters as he fought his way through the ambush. The second master Hunter has disappeared into the Border Worlds after him.
56172
A New Regent for Cambridge
56173
CAMBRIDGE — In a shocking move, Lord Arthur Braintree announced his retirement from the Cambridge University’s Board of Regents yesterday. He cited health problems and a want to: “spend [his] winter amongst family.” This means that a new professor will be chosen by the current regents and the college of professors to ascend to the regency. This position is one of great power in Cambridge, and many say the regents are nearly as powerful as the crown in many respects. There are many possible candidates, but no date has been set for the academic games which will weed out the less worthy scholars.
56174
Gaians Delay Ayr Terraforming Effort
56175
EDINBURGH — New London has asked the Canterbury-based company to provide tangible evidence of its progress in all terraforming efforts following the latest funding request by the troubled Ayr operation. Officials at Planetform blamed the Gaians for causing the Ayr terraforming project to fall so disastrously behind schedule. “The constant attacks that we suffer from the terrorists have created many unanticipated delays,” said William Hendershank, a Planetform executive. The Green Front has called for a full government audit of the Ayr and Harris projects.
56176
Hogosha Seen with Finance Minister
56177
NEW TOKYO — Top Hogosha Boss Ito Lei was spotted dining at a private table with Finance Minister Hiro Tanaka at New Tokyo’s exclusive seafood restaurant Junyo Market last week. The two men came in at different times and Tanaka appeared disguised, but he was still recognized by several of the patrons. According to reports, the two shook hands and sat at a dark table near the back of the restaurant where they spoke for some time and rang up a bill of over three thousand credits on rare Junyo seafood delicacies. The Hogosha boss paid the bill.
56178
Youth Eating up Synth Paste
56179
NEW TOKYO — The hardworking farmers of Kyushu would be sorry to see the number of Kusari youth buying foreign foods these days. It looks like the newest trend is Synth Paste. Many of New Tokyo’s young and hip are attracted to the Liberty corporation’s new flavors that were specifically designed for the Kusari market. Among the choices are flavors like Golden Squid and Green Sea.
56180
What’s Wrong with Artifacts?
56181
NEW TOKYO — Many private Artifact dealers are going out of business because of Liberty’s newest Sirius-wide campaign against Artifacts. A recent poll shows that 82 percent of the New Tokyo populace regards the ban on the Artifact trade as unnecessary and ridiculous. “We are the only ones suffering,” remarked Hayato Fujimoto, a New Tokyo Artifact dealer who has filed for bankruptcy. “Everyone is still buying just as many Artifacts, but with our government bowing to the foreigners’ demands we can no longer do it openly, so legitimate business suffers.”
56182
Cardamine Sweeping the Capital
56183
ROPPONGI — The foreign presence in Roppongi has always been viewed as a necessary evil, but Kusari citizens are now facing a new threat to the moral fiber of Kusari. Cardamine from Roppongi has appeared on our home planet. Many New Tokyo youths flock to the bars and discos of Roppongi, where they are exposed to Cardamine and other corrupting influences of the foreigners. “My son is strictly forbidden from visiting that lair of miscreants, yet I found out that he has been going without my knowledge,” said Father Jin Takashi.
56184
Pirates Murder Liberty Crew
56185
IZU — A Synth Foods transport ship was destroyed and all hands lost last week when the Farmers Alliance staged one of their most vicious attacks. The transport was passing Izu Moon when Alliance ships engaged it. According to recorded communications, the Paste transport surrendered and was expelling cargo when the Alliance vessels opened fire. “We are dismayed to see that this was a case not just of piracy, but of cold-blooded murder,” quoted IC representative John Wilkins. Shortly after the attack, Synth Foods responded by cutting prices on its most popular brands in New Tokyo, further increasing pressure on Kyushu food growers.
56186
Kishiro and Samura in Court
56187
SHINJUKU — Kishiro filed a suit against Samura yesterday, accusing the giant Shinjuku conglomerate of purchasing goods that had been stolen from Kishiro depots. “These items were discovered by a State Police customs inspector that performed a routine scan of a Samura transport bound for Yokohama. She discovered a container of Optical Chips that had been stolen from the Shinagawa storage depot several days before,” the Kishiro lawyers said. A Samura spokesman called the accusations, “A malicious and absurd attempt by Kishiro to soil Samura’s good name.”
56188
Strife at Narita
56189
NARITA — Republican Shipping has lodged an official complaint against the Kusari government for what it calls “a complete lack of concern over the damage being done to foreign shipping by open piracy.” The Rheinland corporation and several others are concerned about the number of attacks their vessels have undergone in Kusari near their shipping destination, specifically Narita. The Kusari government responded in an official communication stating, “The attacks upon foreign shipping concerns do not vary from the hostile actions that Kusari vessels must also withstand.”
56190
Junyo Workers Fall Ill
56191
SHIKOKU — Many of the employees working the fish farms of Junyo have been complaining of fatigue caused by an unidentified ailment. Samura doctors and scientists have been dispatched to investigate the strange illnesses that resulted in a record number of sick days in recent months. Those employees working in the Alien Organism processing decks have displayed the most serious symptoms. Officials at Samura’s Shinjuku headquarters were unavailable for comment.
56192
Shikoku Crime Wave Hits Workers
56193
JUNYO — Many of Junyo’s workers are threatening to leave the planetside seafood farms if something is not done about the ever-increasing crime rates in Shikoku. The system is infamous for its prison and the foreigners’ base at Deshima. A large percentage of the employees who work on Junyo are forced to live at Deshima because of housing costs on the Junyo platforms and the lack of alternatives to the Bounty Hunter-owned base. “I don’t like being worried every time my transport enters the Trade Lanes,” quoted one fish farmer about his commute.
56194
Prison Revolt Suppressed
56195
FUCHU — Thanks to immediate action on the part of the Kusari Police stationed at Fuchu Prison, a small revolt that could have ended in a major catastrophe was avoided. A group of 17 foreign prisoners captured a weapon from three guards in a prison wing and took several other guards hostage. They then released other inmates and barricaded themselves in. The convicts had the supplies to withstand a siege for some time, so prison officials decompressed the area, killing all within. “The guards were probably already dead, so we did what was necessary,” quoted the warden.
56196
Two Dead after Rocket goes Astray
56197
DESHIMA — Liberty native Bounty Hunter Bill Parker will stand trial for manslaughter and criminal negligence next week for the slaying of two unarmed civilians aboard Deshima Station. According to reports, Parker killed two and wounded three more when he fired a small high explosive-tipped rocket at a fleeing criminal. The rocket went wide and instead of striking the intended target, veered into an open doorway and exploded. If Parker is convicted, he will serve ten years aboard Fuchu.
56198
Explosion in Bio-Dome Injures Two
56199
DESHIMA — It is believed that Farmers Alliance operatives planted the bomb that destroyed a portion of Deshima’s cellulose crop on Tuesday of last week. The bomb blast also seriously wounded two biodome tenders and caused minor injuries to 15 more. Immediately following the explosion, the Bounty Hunters Guild began a full investigation into the events, and many Hunters left the station to hunt for the perpetrators. “Those who did this will be found and punished severely,” said Bounty Hunter Ken Wallace.
56200
GC Popular with Younger Women
56201
NEW TOKYO — An independent news organization conducted a secret poll recently and discovered some surprising results. It appears that three-quarters of the female population in New Tokyo under the age of thirty support the actions of the terrorist group Golden Chrysanthemums. Many of those questioned in the polls stated that they believe what the Golden C. is doing is best for Kusari in the long run. Government sources responded to the findings in an official statement, “Since the terrorist organization began operations Cardamine abuse is up 200 percent, and piracy is up 29 percent.”
56202
Alliance Candidate Ahead in Polls
56203
KYUSHU — Many have been surprised by Farmers Alliance-backed gubernatorial candidate for Kyushu Hakita Toho’s popularity and strength in the polls. It appears that Toho has a strong lead over the current governor and incumbent Hitoshi Sasaki. Toho has been electrifying his audiences at rallies in the past two months, and now it looks like all that leg work is starting to pay off. The elections will be held within the next two weeks, and everyone is watching to see who will emerge as the new leader of Kyushu.
56204
Samura CEO Visits Kyushu
56205
KYUSHU — The current head of Samura Industries honored the people of Kyushu during his visit to the garden planet last week. After touring several traditional rice farms, Nora Samura gave a rousing speech that many believe could reinvigorate the working spirit on the planet and throughout the system. He praised the work ethic of the laborers within Kyushu, citing their dedication and honorable family values. He stated, “Samura is blessed by all those here that have contributed so much to the strength of our great company and to all of Kusari.”
56206
Kyushu Land Values Plummeting
56207
KYUSHU — The price of land on Kyushu has been dropping steeply recently. The real estate industry attributes the decline to so many people leaving the planet to make their futures in New Tokyo or Honshu. This migration includes primarily the younger segment of the population, but some older families are among the outflow as well. Many local residents blame Synth Foods and its low-cost foods that are enjoying such popularity in New Tokyo and Honshu. “If those fools in New Tokyo wouldn’t buy the Paste, then Synth would leave Kusari and my son would still be here,” said farmer Hisaki Okimoto.
56208
Nansei Accident Kills 102
56209
NANSEI — Antimatter is suspected as the cause of a horrific explosion that rocked the Nansei Research Station yesterday. The entire wing that housed the experiment was completely destroyed, killing everyone within. The resulting decompression of several decks killed dozens more. This is the worst incident of this kind ever to occur at Nansei. Government investigators arrived today from New Tokyo to determine the cause of the terrible tragedy.
56210
Unemployment Hits 30 Year High
56211
KYUSHU — It is a bleak time for the residents of Kyushu. The planet and the system are suffering through one of the worst periods of unemployment in its history. Most blame the Food and Consumer Goods produced by foreign hands in Shikoku for their troubles. The last Consumer Goods factory in Kyushu closed its doors more than a month ago, and many are leaving the system to find work in New Tokyo where it is hoped that jobs will be easier to find.
56212
Military Intercepts Drug Shipment

BATTLESHIP NAGUMO — A Kusari Naval Forces patrol based on battleship Nagumo intercepted three Golden Chrysanthemum ships heading west through the north edge of the Ohka Dust Field. The three smugglers came back positive on Cardamine scans and did not respond when ordered to stop. The military patrol then engaged and destroyed the enemy; a large amount of the illegal drug was collected from the wreckage. Only one military craft was destroyed in the engagement.
56214
Blood Dragons Attack Again
56215
TSUSHIMA — The ice mining facilities at Tsushima have suffered another devastating attack at the hands of the Blood Dragons. The terrorists made their move last week at the end of the day when the miners were cycling down and returning to the station. Six miners were killed and many more wounded as the transports tried to run back to the station amid weapon salvos. This is the fifth Blood Dragon attack in the past three weeks, and many are wondering if the battleship Nagumo is any deterrent at all.
56216
Blood Dragon Threat Diminishes
56217
NEW TOKYO — According to statistics and information gathered by the Kusari Military Intelligence Bureau, Blood Dragon activities are inexorably being purged from Kusari space, and the total number of the cursed pirates is declining. “It has been a hard-fought battle, but we are winning the war against evil,” quoted Admiral Nobu, head of the Intelligence Bureau. Some skeptics say that these reports may be inaccurate since the actual number of Blood Dragon attacks has not diminished in recent years.
56218
Factories Operating at Full Capacity
56219
HONSHU — Manufacturing facilities are booming in Honshu. “Everyone is working, and the new positions that pop up each day are filled immediately. Our employees are doing very well,” said Tomoko Hatori, a Kishiro public relations director. Kishiro is running the facility on three shifts so that the factories can produce nonstop. Many ex-Samura employees have come into the system from Kyushu looking for jobs, but Kishiro stated in an official release that they would first hire Honshu natives before taking in any Kyushu immigrants.
56220
GMG Coming Home
56221
HONSHU — With the advancements in ship engineering and Trade Lanes, it is no longer necessary for Nebula gas miners to be away for years at a time. A recent trend among some of the GMG is to establish residence on Honshu as a home away from their usual haunts in the Sigma systems. Honshu residents have mixed feelings. “Why should we be glad about them coming back?” asked one Honshu native. Another spoke differently, “I’m honored that these men and women have returned to their homeland, if only for part of the time.”
56222
Hogosha Boss Murdered
56223
HONSHU — A high-ranking member of the Hogosha crime syndicate was found dead in his Honshu hotel room early today. Police Detectives believe that the boss was beaten to death with an Alien Artifact found in his hand. They later added that his two bodyguards were also killed in the pre-dawn incident. Officers had responded to a call from the hotelier and stormed the establishment after other occupants complained of gunfire. The police are following several leads.
56224
Corsairs in Honshu
56225
AKITA — State Police patrol craft spotted Corsairs in the Hiryo Cloud traveling north towards the Chuyu. The patrol hailed the pirates, but when they did not respond, the police engaged them. Almost immediately a police ship was destroyed, and the remaining three sent distress calls for backup. One of the Corsairs is believed to be the infamous Rosita Garcia, known for her daring attacks and incredible skill as a pilot. Four more ships were scrambled from Akita and assisted the wounded police craft as they fled back to the base. Neither Corsair was captured or destroyed.
56226
Osaka Negotiations Deadlocked
56227
OSAKA — After the third week of talks, it looks like Samura and the GMG cannot find common ground in negotiating future gas mining contracts. Samura representatives are not accepting the elevated prices that the GMG has proposed for business between the two entities. “The prices they are asking for are much higher than what we are paying in the current contracts,” said one Samura source. The GMG has argued that it is becoming more expensive to mine gas since its ships must go further afield looking for new gas sources.
56228
GMG Announces Plan for Sigma-19
56229
AOMORI — Kishiro has been awarded the new GMG contract to build an addition to the Ogashawa Mining Station in Sigma-19. There have been rumors that the expansion will double the current size of Ogashawa, surpassing the Osaka facility’s capacity. Many speculate that this is a major step for the GMG away from their centuries-old relationship with Samura. When questioned about a new GMG partnership, Kishiro sources responded, “Kishiro has been hired by the GMG to help build the station’s new wing; no other contracts have been made. Anything else is hearsay.”
56230
Yukawa Posts Record Earnings
56231
YUKAWA — Yukawa Shipyards, home of Kishiro’s famous Civilian Class spacecraft, is reporting record profits this quarter. “We are very excited about what this means for our company and shipbuilding in Kusari,” said Kazu Noda, Kishiro master ship builder. Many are beginning to question who will emerge as the dominant Kusari corporation in the coming years, especially if things continue to develop as they have of late. Samura’s long reign as the largest corporation in the Sirius Sector may be over.
56232
Hawaii Popular among Kusari Youth
56233
HAWAII — The lure of the Border Worlds has captured the imaginations of youth throughout Kusari. The hottest ticket this year is the Hawaii, Orbital Spa and Cruise Line’s luxury liner. Parents throughout the empire are paying top dollar for exclusive tickets so that their children can be dazzled by the best there is to offer in luxury vacationing. Many parents are worried that the Border Worlds may be too dangerous to visit, but representatives from Orbital have reassured the public that safety is of paramount concern.
56234
Tensions Run High among Shippers
56235
GALILEO — Interspace Commerce reports that damage claims have increased two-fold during the past twelve months in Galileo as shippers of the two houses use underhanded methods to sabotage competitors’ ships in the lightly patrolled Independent Worlds. The illegal behavior has been increasing steadily since Synth Foods was first granted access to Kusari food markets more than a decade ago.
56236
IC Hikes IW Cargo Rates
56237
GALILEO — Shipping insurance giant IC has once again raised premiums on cargoes traveling through the Independent Worlds. Company executives claim that without additional military protection they can no longer assume the costs of lost cargo, given the current rate structure. They also specifically cited the inability of the Kusari military to properly secure the safety of vessels near the Shikoku Jump Gate. The Kusari government and Samura condemned the action, asserting that Liberty criminals inhabiting those areas were responsible for the bulk of the recent insured losses.
56238
Famous Kepler Storm no Hoax?
56239
KEPLER — The phantom dark matter storm that was estimated to hit the Kepler system in 730 AS has yet to arrive, and most people don’t believe it ever will. But many residents of the Ames Research Station and some scientists in Liberty space still believe it may be a real possibility. Ageira scientists believed that a storm passing through Kepler would destroy everything within the system. This was the justification used by company executives to convince the Liberty government to build the auxiliary Trade Lane routes and Jump Gates through Galileo. The ensuing scandal fueled the growth of the Lane Hacker criminal organization.
56240
Kusari Traces IW Pirates to Liberty
56241
KEPLER — In a blunt communication sent to Manhattan from New Tokyo, the Kusari government blamed Liberty for the pirate troubles in the Independent Worlds between the two Houses. The key to their claim is the number of area pirates that can be traced to Colorado or other Liberty systems. Manhattan issued a terse reply to sum up Liberty’s official position. The Independent Worlds are not the territory of either House, and therefore any pirates who operate in that area are not the personal responsibility of Liberty’s government.
56242
Piracy Costs Millions Annually
56243
CORTEZ — IC has released numbers detailing the credit amount of shipping losses incurred each year by the three criminal groups that populate the system. According to IC statistics, the Lane Hackers are responsible for the greatest loss in profits of stolen goods. The Liberty Rogues account for the most strikes undertaken, and the Outcasts kill more than both of the other two groups combined. “These numbers are very disconcerting, and obviously more must be done to stop the perpetrators of these terrible crimes,” said Raymond Green, an IC representative.
56244
Criminals on Curaçao?
56245
CURAÇAO — Orbital Spa and Cruise Lines responded vehemently to the claim made by a Liberty Security Forces report, which stated that Lane Hackers had occasionally been spotted at the Curaçao resort in the Cortez Border World. The report also inferred that some Orbital staff aware of the infrequent Lane Hacker visits looked the other way because of potential profits from vacationing pirates aboard the base. “This accusation is an outrage,” said an anonymous Orbital executive. “If it were a private organization making such claims, our lawyers would be preparing for a libel suit.”
56246
Hackers Help Outcasts Elude Fate
56247
MAGELLAN — A military patrol witnessed a strange example of fraternity between criminal factions last week when Lane Hackers came to the rescue of a badly damaged Outcast ship. The patrol came upon a single Outcast and damaged his craft considerably, but before they could finish him off four Lane Hacker ships swept in and fended off the patrol until the Outcast’s nanobots got the engines going again. The Hackers provided cover for the ship until the pilot escaped, and then they retreated into the Barrier Ice Cloud.
56248
New York Proposes New Patrols
56249
MANHATTAN — The Liberty Navy announced today that it will soon extend its patrol routes to include the previously unprotected stretches of Trade Lanes extending into the Barrier Cloud east of Freeport 4 and Curaçao. New London has supported the move, noting that the Bretonia security forces will be unable to fulfill their patrol duties in the Independent Worlds for some time to come. Observers of the situation remarked that the Bretonia Armed Forces is more concerned with possible Molly attacks on New London than rampant piracy outside of its frontiers.
56250
Liberty Outlaws Aid to Criminals
56251
BERING — Liberty has long accused Zoners of what it called “aiding and abetting felonious criminal elements.” In the new law signed yesterday by the President, any Zoners who sell goods or services to any criminal group have broken Liberty law and therefore are criminals themselves. Though Liberty said it would not pursue anyone in the Border Worlds for this new crime, criminals will be arrested if they enter Liberty space. A Zoner spokesman replied, “It’s that type of foolishness that drove us away from that police state called Liberty.”
56252
Crime Levels Similar in IW Systems
56253
BERING — Both Rheinland and Liberty shippers have been looking for a means of safe passage between their two Houses for as long as anyone can remember, but there is no easy answer. Shipping has been increasing in Bering since the crime rates began to climb in Hudson, but according to IC statistics, one system is just as dangerous as the other. “Either way your shipments have the same likelihood of being pirated — it just becomes a matter of who you want your pirates to be,” quipped Fred Masters, IC rate adjustor.
56254
Planetform Will not Return to Hudson
56255
HUDSON — Planetform, Inc has refused Liberty’s request to resurvey Planet Atka for terraforming appraisals and estimates. The Bretonian company responded directly to New York’s latest overture with an official memo stating, “Planetform can see no reason to endanger the lives of its employees or allow the possibility of damage to valuable equipment. If Liberty can guarantee the safety of the Independent World system for the passage of a second survey ship, then preparations will commence. Until then it is an impossibility.” Planetform lost one of its ships to Xenos the last time it entered Hudson.
56256
Hudson: Soon to be Part of Liberty?
56257
MANHATTAN — Rheinland officials emerged from closed-door meetings with the Liberty government confident that a compromise can be announced shortly regarding Liberty’s desire to annex the Hudson system. A source close to the negotiations confided that merely defining the precise terms of the landmark agreement is what is necessary at this point. The Rheinland government is nearly bankrupt and desperately needs immediate financial assistance to pay police and military personnel.
56258
Companies Clash in Docking Dispute
56259
HOLMAN OUTPOST — The IMG-owned Holman Outpost in Tau-31 was the site of an angry confrontation between IMG and BMM personnel this week. An inbound BMM freighter from Tau-23 had to make an emergency docking after being damaged during an Outcast attack. Docking control, underestimating the seriousness of the damage to the BMM vessel, did not allow the crippled ship to land for two hours, claiming that its bay was full. Only when the pressurization system began to fail on the BMM vessel did the controllers realize the gravity of the situation. A brawl erupted between the BMM crew and IMG dock workers when the crew emerged from their ship.
56260
Dissension over Tau Border Worlds
56261
FREEPORT 6 — The Kusari and Bretonia governments have offered sharply different views of the growing problem of Outcast piracy along the Tau system Trade Lanes in recent months. New Tokyo blames Bretonia for provoking the Outcast attacks by pushing too aggressively into the Tau-23 system. New London denies the accusations, attributing the growing losses to increased Samura activity in the northern area of Tau-29. An IC official close to the matter admitted that both arguments have some validity.
56262
BMM Battles for Survival in Tau-23
56263
TAU-23 — The BMM mining operation in Tau-23 is under daily attack by Outcasts, according to a company spokesman in Leeds. The Beryllium mining operation continues to operate at 30 percent capacity, but the Trade Lane access route construction has fallen far behind schedule and is suffering mounting losses due to nonstop Outcast attacks. DSE personnel assigned to the project have threatened to walk off the job unless BMM can dramatically increase its security forces within the area. Anonymous sources within the company admit that the Bretonia military has so far refused requests for assistance.
56264
Kusari Plans Jump Gate to Tau-23
56265
NEW TOKYO — The Kusari government announced a plan today to build a Jump Gate from Tau-29 directly into the Outcast-controlled area of Tau-23. Those familiar with the Tau Border World situation see it as a desperate last-ditch effort by Kusari to get in on the riches of Tau-23 before it is completely locked out by BMM and the IMG. An IC official in Roppongi issued a press release shortly thereafter, stating that IC would not insure any aspect of the proposed Gate.
56266
IC to stop Insuring Omega Shipping
56267
FREISTADT — In recent weeks, the number of attacks on shipping by Hessians and Corsairs has reached crisis levels within Omega-7. Only 50 percent of all convoys have successfully completed their trips. Interspace Commerce has threatened to issue a travel warning for all shipping companies as soon as tomorrow, which would effectively shut down the Bretonia-Rheinland trade. Travel warnings represent the most serious threat level assessed by IC, effectively ceasing any insurance coverage for a shipper who dares venture forth.
56268
IC: Rheinland Must Take Action
56269
BONN — Interspace Commerce officials again pleaded their case with the representatives of the Rheinland Military in tense meetings on the Bonn Station, sources report. The military reiterated that it doesn’t even have the money to pay personnel serving on the battleship Westfalen in Hamburg, let alone patrol dangerous systems like Omega-7. Liberty has offered to pay for a special Federal Police patrol within the system, but so far New Berlin has refused direct assistance in this matter.
56270
Omega-11 Offers Dangerous Riches
56271
SOLARIUS — Sheltered by a dying planet at the far side of the Walker Nebula, Solarius is an unlikely place to find people seeking their fortune. It’s the abundant Diamonds found in the Von Rohe Belt that bring amateur miners from around Sirius to this lonely station. But success does not come easily to most. The system’s dying red-giant sun stands guard over those who are foolish or brave enough to gamble their lives for instant riches. The belt is littered with ships that were unable to escape the intense radiation storms that constantly sweep across the system with little advance notice.
56272
Two Companies Spar in Omega-3
56273
FREEPORT 1 — Looking across the vast ice fields of the Barrier, one could imagine that there is little economic value to find. In reality, the asteroids in Omega-3 contain valuable Hydrocarbons that have become the focus of competing claims by BMM and Daumann within the system. So far BMM appears to have the upper hand, thanks to the efforts of the Red Hessians, who harbor a deep hatred for all things Daumann. But the Corsairs may tip the balance in Daumann’s favor, as they do not discriminate when choosing their victims.
56274
Cleanup of Sigma-13 on Schedule
56275
HELGOLAND — An ALG spokeswoman confirmed today that the company still hopes to meet its target completion date of 805 for the cleanup of the old Rheinland Navy relics left from the Eighty Years’ War. “The Junkers have proven to be somewhat slower salvage workers than we anticipated,” said Erna Roth. She added that ALG will implement a special incentive program beginning next month to motivate the Junkers to complete their salvage operations in a timely fashion.
56276
Is the GMG in Control of Sigma-13?
56277
NAHA — Kusari and Rheinland shippers are questioning whether the GMG can control the mounting menace of Outcasts and Corsairs crossing its space within Sigma-13. Despite frequent GMG patrols, criminal activity in the system has steadily risen since the arrival of the Junkers and ALG several years ago. The Rheinland Military is forbidden to enter the system according to the rules laid out in the treaty that ended the Eighty Years’ War. The Kusari Naval Forces are also reluctant to undertake the task, given New Tokyo’s often complicated relationship with the fiercely independent Guild.
56278
Orbital Spa Aiding Artifact Trade?
56279
HAWAII — One look around the lobby of this luxury cruise ship and one can see what all the fuss is about. Hogosha and Corsairs are regularly spotted around this posh Sigma-19 resort, presumably engaged in their illegal Artifact trading activities. Orbital executives have come under intense pressure from New York to halt landing privileges for the Corsairs. In its own defense, Orbital has stated that if it ever offended the vicious Edge World pirates, the Hawaii would be reduced to a flaming wreck within days.
56280
Outcasts Continue Sigma-17 Attacks
56281
KURILE — The Outcasts continue to apply pressure in the Sigma-17 system, this time against corporate shipping. Several Samura transports and Cryer Research ships have been destroyed with all hands lost following a series of especially merciless attacks in recent days, leading authorities to speculate that the Outcasts harbor particularly negative feelings towards the two corporations active in the area. In all cases, the cargos of Alien Organisms were destroyed on the spot by the pirates.
56282
Pirates Threaten GMG Territory
56283
NAHA — Recent brazen attacks by Outcasts and Corsairs within the Sigma-13 system underline the need for greater security investment by the GMG. Current proposals range from building an early warning array of satellites across the system to surrounding all known Jump Holes with rings of weapon platforms. The Zoners have objected to the latter solution, noting that the Cambridge Line has proven useless in preventing Corsair attacks in Bretonia. One thing is certain — we can no longer sit idly by and let the pirates terrorize us.
56284
Sigma-13 Gas Reserves Exhausted?
56285
NAHA — The GMG production group released a 20-year estimate for the Sigma-13 system H-Fuel reserves yesterday. The findings were alarming: a steep decline in gas production during the next ten years, leading to an economically unviable operation by 815 AS. The Council took this as a sign that it is time for the GMG to gradually begin moving all of its operations to Sigma-17. In anticipation of the eventual migration, a new deal was recently signed with Kishiro to finance the expansion of the Ogashawa platform.
56286
Contact Lost with Expedition
56287
OGASHAWA — The Hosho Maru and her escorts sailed forth from Ogashawa two months ago in search of new gas fields in the Edge Nebula. Initial transmissions received from the expedition were not promising in terms of H-Fuel discoveries, but the explorers had encountered vast fields of Alien Organisms. Shortly thereafter, contact was lost. It is feared that the group encountered hostile Outcasts, since that area of the Edge Nebula is widely known to be the Outcasts’ home territory.
56288
Youth Return to Their Homeland
56289
AOMORI — Younger GMG members are leaving the hard and lonely life of the Guild in record numbers. Most of them are headed for Honshu, where the Kishiro factories are booming. It is a sad day for the Guild when we can no longer offer our children the life that they desire, but if that is their wish, then it should be so. We must expand further into the Edge and find a homeland of our own after all these centuries. Then our young will no longer dream of life on Kusari planets.
56290
The Battle for Omega-5
56291
FREISTADT — The war between the Red Hessians and the Corsairs has been fought for many years. After countless losses on both sides, it appears that neither faction can claim victory. The Red Hessians have greater numbers, but the Corsairs are the superior pilots and have better equipment. Someday this war will come to an end, but not before one of these two powerful forces is brought to its knees. Omega-5 is a dangerous system to enter since both sides will likely fire on any vessels within the battlefield.
56292
No Junkers In Kusari
56293
ROCHESTER — Ever wondered why there are no Junkers in Kusari? The answer is simple: the Hogosha. The Junkers want to expand into every corner of Sirius space, hoping to exploit the underworld trade in each House. But, true to their isolated nature, the Kusari crime syndicate has kept the foreigners out of Kusari systems. Open conflict has not erupted between the two opposing factions because it is not the Junkers’ way to wage open war. For now, the enterprising scavengers will bide their time until an opportunity in Kusari presents itself.
56294
The Children of Hispania
56295
TRAFALGAR — It is rumored that the two fiercest pirate groups in Sirius both came from the same ship: the lost Sleeper Ship Hispania. While this is only hearsay, many believe the tales to be true about the two great factions. Nowadays, both the Outcasts and the Corsairs clash in incredible battles of skill and grace, but these rivalries occur primarily because of territorial disputes in the Sigma Border Worlds and southern Bretonia. There is no intrinsic hatred between them, only a ruthlessness that goes beyond any common ties.
56296
The Gold of Dublin
56297
TRAFALGAR — The Corsairs have poured into Bretonia from the southern Border Worlds to find rich hunting grounds and fields of Gold. This has put them at odds with the Bretonian criminal group the Mollys, who claim Dublin and its Gold as theirs. A fierce struggle has ensued between the two for the right to be Bretonia’s dominant pirate faction. It appears as if the Corsairs are holding their own against the tenacious Mollys, but only time will tell who has the right to pilfer the queen’s coffers.
56298
Kindred Spirits
56299
DARMSTADT — There are two groups within Sirius that have never met each other, yet fight for almost the exact same things in different houses. The common link between the groups? Synth Foods. The Farmers Alliance of Kusari and the LWB of Rheinland are both fighting the Liberty corporation desperately, in an attempt to rid their homelands of the ever-encroaching food pastes that feed the majority of Sirius. The LWB is particularly interested in ending the Synth occupation of Planet Stuttgart, while the Farmers Alliance is battling for control of the Kusari food markets.
56300
Changing the Status Quo in Kusari
56301
KYOTO — The Hogosha crime syndicate is trying to keep things as they are in the Kusari Empire. This brings them into conflict with the Blood Dragons, a faction whose primary goal is to overthrow the government. It also puts them at odds with the Golden Chrysanthemums, another group that is striving for revolution in Kusari, but for different reasons. The Dragons wish to eliminate government corruption and the Golden C. aims to bring about a new age for women, yet the common goal for these two groups brings them together as allies against the Hogosha.
56302
Neutral Ground for Everyone
56303
ROCHESTER — It doesn’t matter what group of criminals you belong to unless you are a Xeno. You are always welcome at a Junker base because you are a potential customer for black market items. From Molly Gold to Corsair Artifacts, the Junkers are willing to buy, sell or trade it all. They also deal in basic Commodities and therefore supply many outlaws. Junker bases also serve as neutral areas for criminals to meet without conflict.
56304
The Xeno Angle
56305
OURAY — Many do not understand the radical view that the Xenos take against foreigners and Junkers. The Xenos are the remnants of Liberty’s working-class population in Colorado and Texas. The group blames foreign business interests for the closure of most Liberty factories. Having been kicked to the bottom, Xenos see their only option as clawing their way back to the top. Any outsiders are enemies to them, including the Junkers.
56306
The Cardamine Connection
56307
BUFFALO — The trade and use of Cardamine has brought three criminal factions together around the Outcasts, who produce the powerful narcotic. The Golden C. uses Cardamine as part of their ritualistic subculture and distributes it into Kusari space. The Lane Hackers trade valuable shipping information to the Outcasts in exchange for the drug. Finally, there are the Rogues. They supply and shelter the Outcast smugglers on their way through Liberty space. This symbiotic relationship has been very effective in spreading the drug throughout Sirius.
56308
Bounty Hunters: Despised By All
56309
HOUSTON — Criminals who’ve gone bad and have no problem hunting down their own join the Bounty Hunters Guild. Every crime organization in Sirius has lost many of their numbers to this group and will lose more. The worst insult to most pirates: Once the Bounty Hunter was just like him or her but now is a lapdog to the corporations. Hunters know the Jump Hole networks and how outlaws operate, which makes them more dangerous than police or military. If you have the opportunity to kill one of them, don’t hesitate.
56310
Reformers Seek End to Corruption
56311
BRUCHSAL — The Bundschuh of Rheinland and the Blood Dragons of Kusari are organizations that have committed themselves to political ideals over promises of gain by way of murder and piracy. The two groups are motivated by the desire to root out corruption from within their respective governments. The similarities between the Bundschuh and Blood Dragons are illuminating: Both groups believe that it is the influence of corporations that has steered the leadership of their Houses towards corruption and decay. It is also very unlikely that a Bundschuh has ever met a Blood Dragon.
56312
On a Razor’s Edge
56313
FREEPORT 10 — The relationship between Zoners and Outcasts is a precarious one. The Outcasts view the Zoners as somewhat useful, so they do not attack them. The moment that the Outcasts no longer find the Zoners necessary, they will have no compunctions about slaughtering any who are in or near their space. The IMG has a much worse rapport with the faction. Outcasts will kill any miners they come across in the northern Edge Worlds. The last thing that Outcasts want is undue attention from outside factions in their territory.
56314
The Zoners in Southern Sirius
56315
FREEPORT 9 — Corsairs and Zoners get along together reasonably well because of the large quantities of Corsair Food produced on Freeport 9, but there is some question as to whether operations like it will continue to be allowed to operate so freely by the Corsairs. The presence of Bounty Hunters in Zoner freeports has been the source of mounting tension between the Corsairs and their deliberately neutral neighbors.
56316
Mining in the Blood
56317
THE HOOD — The IMG miners, who operate the Hood, get along well with the Mollys, who purchase most of their supplies from the merchants aboard the derelict battleship. Both groups are miners, and though the Mollys have no true allies, the IMG probably come the closest. The IMG are Molly sympathizers, though they have chosen not to criminalize themselves within Bretonia. Like the Mollys, many IMG are former BMM employees, and both groups share a mutual and understandable hatred for the oppressive Bretonian mining firm.
56318
Red Hessians Accept Fellow Miners
56319
FREISTADT — Though it has been a long time since the Red Hessians were exclusively miners, they can still appreciate the work that the IMG does to operate independently of corporate and House control in Sirius. Red Hessians and IMG conduct business at the IMG base Freistadt in Omega-7, where they trade Commodities of all kinds from basic supplies to engines. Historically a Bretonian organization, Rheinland miners flocked to the IMG after the Eighty Years’ War, and the common ancestry between the two groups is not overlooked by either faction.
56320
Noted Hessian dies in Failed Escape
56321
VIERLANDE — Brigade Commander Fritz Hochsted was killed during a failed attempt to escape from his cell aboard the feared Rheinland Federal Prison in Hamburg. He had been sending radio messages from inside the Vierlande to his executive officer for several weeks in an attempt to coordinate a raid with the escape attempt. Unfortunately, the plan failed when his brigade was unable to reach the prison due to authority intervention. The commander fought his way to an airlock and held it until he realized that his ships were not coming. Rather than die at the hands of his captors, he opened the door to the vacuum of open space.
56322
Red Hessian Membership Increasing
56323
DRESDEN — It doesn’t take much in these times of economic woe to convince adventure-hearted civilians to become a part of the Hessians. Many who cannot find work are deciding that a pirate’s life is right for them. From Dresden to New Berlin men and women are coming into the fold, and it is only strengthening the organization. The Red Hessians have suffered tragic losses in the war against the Corsairs, but new pilots flood to the Ronneburg daily. Soon the Hessians will stretch from Rheinland to Bretonia.
56324
The Twilight Brigade Destroyed
56325
RONNEBURG — It is a sad day for Red Hessians throughout Sirius. During a recent battle in Omega-5, we suffered great losses. Two of our best brigades defended Hessian territory against a large Corsair attack force and fought them to a standstill just outside of Ronneburg. “We knew they were going to destroy our base if we didn’t stop them,” said Hessian Erik Schultz. “The Twilight got the worst of it; I don’t think many of those boys made it.” Schultz is correct in his estimation; there are only four living members of the Twilight Brigade after the recent engagement.
56326
Largest Diamond Heist Ever
56327
DRESDEN — Though Daumann has not announced it publicly, Hessian forces recently captured the largest Diamond shipment in the history of the organization. The Black Wolves launched an attack upon two armored transports as they made their way towards the New Berlin Gate. Some casualties occurred, but they died for the glory of the workers of Rheinland. Fleet Commander Heinrich Pulger coordinated the planning of the attack using detailed information he learned about the shipment from sources inside Daumann.
56328
Hogosha Boss Assassinated
56329
NEW TOKYO — Noted Hogosha criminal Taki Fujimata met an unfortunate demise in his residence a few days ago at the hands of Blood Dragon commandos. Fujimata was responsible for the strikes upon six intelligence-gathering operatives that were in position in New Tokyo. His death insures greater mobility and safety for our undercover agents in the capital. Fujimata was a well-liked figure within the Hogosha leadership, and rumors are already circulating that a reprisal attack may soon be forthcoming.
56330
Sakura Strike Planned
56331
CHUGOKU — With the approach of the Sakura Festival, the Blood Dragons will mourn the anniversary of the fall of the Hideyoshi Shogunate. This is a day of great shame not only for the Blood Dragons but for all the people of Kusari. It is our sacred role to reestablish a legitimate government. On this anniversary Kusari will be reminded of how our honor was taken from us. Expect a day of reckoning during the upcoming Sakura Festival. Our leaders shall not let the travesty that occurred centuries ago be forgotten.
56332
A Close Call
56333
KYOTO — Two Kusari Naval Forces fighters were intercepted yesterday by a patrol near the Hokkaido Jump Hole. It is theorized that they stumbled across the Hole in the Kayo Cloud by accident. Five more ships were immediately dispatched to the area, and the hunt began. The two ships were destroyed just as they were about to exit the system. Fortunately, the high electromagnetic interference present in the Kayo Cloud most likely prevented them from making contact with the Matsumoto.

Liberty Rogues Won’t Help Junkers
56335
ROCHESTER — The Rogues have decided not to take sides in the fighting between the Junkers and the Xenos. This decision has raised some tensions in Rochester, where the Junkers are most commonly harassed by Xeno attacks. “We supply the Rogues with almost everything they need. It just ain’t right, them not helping us against those crazy Xenos,” said Junker Abraham Washington. A Rogue pilot who was questioned about the decision had this to say, “It isn’t our place getting into the middle of a fight between two groups we’ve got nothing personal against.”
56336
Rochester: Junker Paradise
56337
ROCHESTER — You can get anything you want in Rochester, from Cardamine to Niobium, and the Junkers who live and work there are proud of that fact. “We have the most extensive supply of black market items available in Sirius, and it hasn’t been easy getting to that point,” Said Jerry Greeley, a Junker merchant. The debris fields of New York supply the Junkers not only with the best stock around, but with all the Scrap Metal they need and plenty of good hiding places to conduct their off-base business transactions.
56338
Rogue Murdered in Bar Dispute
56339
BEAUMONT — Wayne Hancock, a well-liked Liberty Rogue, was killed three days ago when he angered an Outcast drinking next to him at the bar in Beaumont. It is rumored that the two men were arguing, and the Outcast simply drew a weapon and killed the unlucky Rogue. “I heard Wayne say something about how the masks the Outcasts wear look silly. The next thing I know he’s out of his stool and on the floor with four shots in his belly,” said John Kincaid, the bartender who was serving the two.
56340
Outcasts Annihilate Xeno Force
56341
BEAUMONT — A flight of Outcast Cardamine runners was recently attacked by Hudson Xenos near the West Dallas Debris Field. The Xenos underestimated the skill and ships of the Outcasts and quickly found themselves on the losing side of the battle. The three Outcast ships destroyed all of the eight Xeno attack vessels in the skirmish. The Junkers, enemies of the foreign-hating Liberty criminal group, may have found a new ally.
56342
A Corsair and Outcast Romance?
56343
TRAFALGAR — Junkers were surprised last Wednesday to see a female Corsair and a male Outcast having what looked to be an intimate conversation in the Trafalgar lounge area. It is well known that when Corsairs and Outcasts meet in space, a fierce battle usually ensues, but that might not be the case when they aren’t aboard their ships. “I thought they were going to fight when I first noticed them, that is until I heard the woman laughing, I’ve never heard a Corsair laugh before,” said Roger Watkins, Trafalgar bartender.
56344
Confusion over Junkers Return Policy
56345
TRAFALGAR — It is a hard and fast rule of the Junkers: There are no refunds on anything purchased from our supplies. One of the disadvantages of dealing in black market items is the fact that once you buy something you cannot return it. This rule was a point of contention between Trafalgar Junkers and Mollys. The Mollys, angered over some improperly functioning ship engines they had purchased, demanded full refunds. It looked like things might get out of hand before Molly Captain Jacob Crowe overheard the commotion and put a stop to it, siding with reason and ordering his men to accept the deal.
56346
Blue Diamond Prices Going Up
56347
KREUZBERG — The Red Hessians are demanding more for Dresden Diamonds recently and are getting what they ask for. Because of a recent craze for blue Diamonds among the Rheinland elite, it looks like the market is going to bear the higher prices. “It’s really getting ridiculous, the prices they are charging,” said Junker Wilhelm Flores. “They expect fair prices from us, so it should work both ways.” The Red Hessians claim that it is becoming harder to smuggle the Diamonds from the Schwefelnebel. “We lose men and ships every day getting Diamonds here,” said a Hessian smuggler on the situation.
56348
LWB Will Pay for Info on Synth Foods
56349
STUTTGART — The LWB has alerted Kreuzberg that they are looking to buy information about Synth Foods’ activities. “We don’t have all the information we need about their activities and that is hampering our abilities to coordinate an effective resistance against Synth Foods,” said LWB representative Dietrich Leffler. Though the LWB is not renowned as a particularly wealthy or large organization they have made it clear that accurate information will be well rewarded. “We need shipping routes and times, as well as dossiers on top Synth executives,” said Leffler.
56350
Dealing with the Federal Police
56351
YANAGI — Rheinland Junkers are feeling the heat as Rheinland passes more rigorous inspection standards in an attempt to stop the flow of Cardamine into the colony. Junkers have been forced to design more imaginative ways to get the drug into Rheinland space. “The authorities are a bit short of cash right now, so we’ve been able to slip by quite a few State Police patrols with a little extra credits on hand. Usually it works, but sometimes it doesn’t, so you have to be prepared to hit the afterburner,” said Junker smuggler Sonja Kerns.
56352
Yearly Meeting to be Held at Yanagi
56353
YANAGI — Every ten years the organization of men and women who call themselves Junkers comes together at one of the Junker bases; this time around Yanagi will host the event. It is a time for all Junkers to come together to trade wares, ideas, routes, and tales as they review the past decade. New leadership positions will be granted to replace comrades who are no longer with us. New blood will also be brought into the fold with our “Become a Junker” dinner held for Junker children coming of age.
56354
Xenos Gain Ground for Workers
56355
COLORADO — Even if the Liberty government is too spineless to assert the rights of the strongest of the colony Houses, the Xenos still represent the aims of the working class in this space. The Kusari and Rheinland shippers have encountered a new foe as they enter our turf trying to sell their inferior goods to Libertonians, who deserve better. Though our numbers are small, our hearts and backs are strong, and we will prevail. There is no place for the Kusari or Rheinland in Liberty.
56356
Gun Sale!
56357
NEW YORK — This time Liberty’s finest managed to pull off the biggest Xeno Side Arm score in as long as anyone can remember. Twelve of our pilots hit an Ageira armored transport filled with the finest weapons made in Detroit. We only lost four pilots, and now it looks like there will be weapons for everybody. There will be a special sale at the Commodity dealer to clear out the excess inventory. All friends of the Xenos are welcome.
56358
More Folks Coming in from Texas
56359
OURAY — Most of the people that our brotherhood can recruit from the Huntsville usually end up doing their duty in Hudson, but it looks like we might be getting a good number of members from Texas in the next few weeks. Jake Brown, one of our comrades in arms who is languishing in prison down south, is getting out soon, and according to reports, he’s bringing some new recruits with him. Brown was put away when he tangled with one too many LPI ships near Chisos a couple of years ago. Now it looks like his loss is our gain.
56360
Luxury Goods Available
56361
HUDSON — A Republican Shipping convoy carrying Luxury Goods through Hudson on its way to Liberty space was attacked and destroyed by Xeno freedom fighters a few days ago. Since nobody we deal with has the money to buy the goods, we are distributing them to our own brethren to improve the quality of life for Xenos in this part of space. Even if you don’t care about Niobium statues and post-neo contemporary paintings, come see what there is; you might find something you like.
56362
Attack on Junker Base a Success
56363
BEAUMONT — It looks like the Junkers will be licking their wounds for quite some time after the most recent Xeno attack at their base in Texas. Our boys came cruising in just as a few Outcast ships were docking at the base. They let lose with a volley of missiles and cruised back out before the Junkers and Outcasts knew what had hit them. “I saw both of my missiles hit home against the base, and there were explosions everywhere,” says Harry Nash, one of our own, about the attack on Beaumont.
56364
Cardamine is the Future
56365
BARROW — What’s the best way to get rid of the corporates and the rich in New York? Cardamine. It must become every Xeno’s goal to wrestle away control of the Cardamine from the Junkers in Liberty. If we could find a way to take over their supplies, we could use the drug to control the Manhattan addicts. This would put us in a much stronger financial position and give us the ability to upgrade our weapons and fleet. Then we could truly begin the revolution that would set the Libertonian working class free from the bonds of corruption that restrict so many of us.
56366
Hogosha Candidate Wins Election
56367
NEW TOKYO — Ryuku Daisama is celebrating tonight in New Tokyo, along with many of our leaders. Daisama was supported by the Hogosha because of his efforts to curb crime in Kusari space. He is a fierce opponent of the Blood Dragons and Golden Chrysanthemums, and his newly won position on the Interstellar Board of Crime Management will help bolster his efforts throughout all of our space. The Hogosha will soon be backing another lucky candidate in the race for the next open position on the board. If you would like to support our efforts, contributions are always accepted.
56368
Hogosha Leader Dishonors Himself
56369
SHIKOKU — One of our own is on his way to Shikoku where he will serve a twelve-year sentence for trafficking Cardamine. This terrible crime must not be perpetrated by the protectors of the Kusari people. The underboss was caught when two of his street-level distributors were apprehended and confessed to working for him. This man has been disavowed by the Hogosha, and it is unlikely that he will live to see the end of his prison sentence. The Hogosha will not tolerate the sale of Cardamine as a means to make money.
56370
Artifact Prices Drop for Distributors
56371
SIGMA-19 — It looks like the profit margins on Artifacts are increasing, which should delight many of our distributors in New Tokyo. The GMG was recently cut out of the Artifact trade between the Hogosha and the Corsairs, resulting in better prices for our organization. Contact was made with Corsair representatives on the Hawaii, and our negotiators offered the pirates more than the GMG was paying them for the Artifacts, but less than the Miners Guild was charging the Hogosha. It looks like everyone will profit, except the GMG.
56372
Near Miss
56373
CURAÇAO — None of our numbers have ever been captured alive, but that fact almost changed recently when one of our own was identified while she was on an impromptu vacation in Curaçao. Sue Williams found herself surrounded by undercover IC operatives at the Orbital Spa and Cruise Lines Resort last week. She was able to send a distress call to a patrol that was passing near the planet. “We got her message. She seemed worried, so Jake and I went to get her out of there,” quoted Hacker pilot Robert Butcher. The two pilots flew in and picked her up just as the IC agents were about to close in.
56374
Hackers Announce Record Profits
56375
MAGELLAN — Despite increased bounties offered by IC and Ageira, Lane Hacker operations are just as successful as ever. This quarter both bases posted record profits from lucrative heists that we pulled off. “I don’t know how Liberty ever gets any Gold from Bretonia with the operations we are pulling,” Lane Hacker executive Bill Hunter quoted. Privately many members admit that mounting Cardamine abuse could be a serious drain on Hacker income if not curbed soon.
56376
Outcasts Threaten Price Increase
56377
LEIDEN — The days of trading information with the Outcasts for Cardamine may soon be drawing to an end as Outcasts threaten to boost Cardamine prices. “The Outcasts have to realize what a service they are getting by trading us for information,” said division manager Gary Holden, “If they try and put the squeeze on us, then they are going to lose millions when they stop getting all those choice shipments.” Information will be withheld from the Edge World Cardamine suppliers if they hike the prices again.
56378
Artifacts Out of Vogue
56379
MACTAN — Every Hacker has Artifacts these days, and it looks like there isn’t much of a market for them among our own numbers. This is a good thing since we can sell directly on Liberty’s black market. “We’ll make more off them if we stop picking the best ones for ourselves anyway, plus with the new ban on Artifacts, the prices should go up, netting us more in the long run,” quoted John Gustafson.
56380
Hackers Killed in Ambush
56381
GALILEO — Gary Burnam, William Lieberman, and Hamilton Jones were all killed when they stumbled into an IC/Bounty Hunter trap last week. The three pilots attacked a Kusari Luxury Goods armored transport as it approached the Galileo Jump Gate in Colorado. They sent a distress call just as they made their first pass. The reports are inconclusive, but it is believed that four Hunter ships were hidden in the transport’s relay signature. Flight leader Burnam gave the order to retreat, but shortly afterward all three of their com-signals went dead. A day later IC paid the Guild three pilot bounties.
56382
Technology Updates from Ageira
56383
COLORADO — Our code breakers cracked the new encryption code that Ageira designed to protect its USI systems. It would not have been possible without the help of our company operatives. It looks like we are still one step ahead of the game; Ageira will have to come up with another way of stopping us from conducting business. Scores of Lane Hackers still work for Ageira and act as informants for our organization. Through their brave contributions, we continue to prosper.
56384
Corsairs Feel the Pain in Dublin
56385
DUBLIN — Dublin is ours, though it looks like we will have to protect our system and our Gold not only from the Bretonian government but from the Corsairs too. Their raids in this system have become increasingly frequent. Over the past month, Mollys have destroyed more than fifteen Corsair ships, but at a price. Six of us will draw breath no more because of these new intruders. We must remain vigilant against these new foes, who are tougher and meaner than any Bretonian military.
56386
Guerrilla Tactics Winning the War
56387
DUBLIN — We may have less money and fewer pilots and resources, but we are winning. The Bretonian military cannot stop us from running operations in this system, nor are things much better for them in the rest of Bretonia, where we can operate freely. Despite setbacks, we have managed to fight Bretonia to a standstill, and we shall continue until we turn the tide. One day the Crown will realize that Dublin is not worth what it must pay to keep her.
56388
Military Gunboat Destroyed
56389
ARRANMORE — The military came too close to our asteroid field this past week and it cost them a gunboat and all hands. The Reginald Harris pursued three of our fighters from the safety of the Essex to the boundaries of our asteroid field, where it paid the price. Five more ships stood ready when the gunboat approached the perimeter of the field, and when she got into range, they let loose with a precisely fired missile salvo into the Harris’ engines. The captain tried to retreat, but with the engines destroyed it was just a matter of dragging the ship into the minefield and letting the mines destroy her.
56390
More Lies from the Corporations
56391
NEW BERLIN — In a press release issued today the Rheinland government stated that industrial casualties are declining. This information was compiled from annual worker statistics generated by Daumann, Krüger, and Republican. Government officials applauded the companies for their strict adherence to the Workers Rights Convention. Do not be fooled; this is nothing more than propaganda created to lull you into apathy. The truth is that these corporations ignore the Convention. Overworked, overpaid miners die every day using unsafe equipment. Metal workers fall into vats of molten metal daily, too tired to be careful. This is no time for complacency.
56392
The Ranks are Swelling
56393
FRANKFURT — It is well known that the Red Hessians have forgotten their political ideas, becoming little more than common pirates. This is unfortunate because justice loses a powerful ally, but all is not lost. Some of the more enlightened members of the Hessians are not satisfied with being common thieves and are coming to the Bundschuh to continue the fight against Rheinland’s corrupt regime. Many of these new members are experienced pilots, tacticians, and soldiers — just what we need to fight our oppressors.
56394
Close Call for Gaian Activist
56395
NEW LONDON — Constance Rogers almost met her end last week when several armed assailants accosted her in New London. Rogers was on her way to a press conference when an unlicensed vehicle rammed the skiff she was riding in. Three men in black jumped out of the marauding craft and unloaded handheld weapons into Rogers’ skiff. Her driver and personal assistant were both killed in the hail of gunfire. Though it is an unfortunate tragedy, we are lucky not to lose Rogers, one of our best lobbyists. She only suffered minor injuries.
56396
Native Species on Gaia nearly Extinct
56397
GAIA — The jeweled wind bird is in danger of becoming extinct because of bacteria brought to the planet by tourists from Leeds. The small multicolored bird that populated the forests of Gaia is rapidly declining in numbers because of the sickness caused by the alien bacteria. The bacteria make the eggs of the wind bird extremely brittle and susceptible to breakage before the fetuses can fully develop. The bacteria have been identified as originating from Leeds and must have been transported by a tourist aboard Orbital Spa’s Shetland liner. The wind bird has been the focus of many works of art because of its dazzling beauty and iridescent feathers.
56398
New Tactics Successful
56399
MANCHESTER — Ice asteroids are a terraformer’s best friend. Ice asteroids found in a system are dumped into the planet’s atmosphere in a warped attempt to change the planet from its natural state into an artificial ecosystem for human beings. Now it looks like ice asteroids may become the terraformer’s worst enemy. A Planetform, Inc. ship slammed into an ice asteroid last week, completely destroying the craft. The asteroid had been dragged by our ships into the Trade Lanes just before a scheduled Planetform run through that area. The regrettable loss of life will stop once Planetform ceases its operation.
56400
Attack in Hamburg a Great Success
56401
ALTONA — Unioners are celebrating tonight after a critical success for the cause in Hamburg yesterday. Four Republican vessels were destroyed in a lightning strike upon the enemy base. Rheinland Federal Police responded quickly to the distress call of the Republican ships, but they arrived too late. Our attack force was already cruising for the Jump Hole out of the system. The success of the mission was attributed to the gunnery skills of the attacking pilots, who scored direct hits with all of their missile salvos.
56402
Stopped Cold by the Hessians
56403
NEW BERLIN — Unioner attempts to gain access to the Dresden Diamond fields were rebuffed yet again by Red Hessian patrols. “They make sure that we don’t make it through the Jump Hole,” said Unioner freedom fighter Otto Kiergard. “It’s almost no time at all before we are surrounded by their ships whenever we enter Dresden, and they are too good and too numerous to fight off.” This is the fourth time in a year that Unioner forces have probed into Red Hessian territory only to be pushed back into New Berlin.
56404
Synth Foods Transport Escapes
56405
HUDSON — Unioner raiders came close to destroying a Synth Foods ship in Hudson that was carrying Paste from Stuttgart to Liberty. Before they could finish the job, the flight of Unioners was set upon by Xenos, who seemed to come to the rescue of the Liberty vessel. The Synth ship was able to flee while our forces engaged the foreign menace. Unioner pilots have been fighting turf wars with the Xenos in Hudson for some time; soon they will be overcome and destroyed.
56406
Infiltrator Uncovered During Initiation
56407
AINU — A government agent was discovered last week when she attempted to become a permanent member of our sisterhood. This is the third such spy. When will the government learn that Matsuda watches over us and will not let interlopers into the house of her visionaries? Unfortunately, a potential sister of ours turned out to be nothing more than an agent for the chauvinists trying to oppress her own gender. It is our duty to enlighten women like her that have been dragged from the truth by the brainwashing of the patriarchal Kusari culture.
56408
Blood Dragons Honor Us
56409
ROPPONGI — Blood Dragon pilot Kozai Suzuki was saved from certain death a few days ago when he sent out a distress call to any Blood Dragons or Golden C. in the area. The sisterhood picked up his message; fortunately, three of our warriors were nearby. They found him in a badly damaged ship fighting off two Hogosha and immediately flew into the fray to assist. Within moments one of the Hogosha was destroyed, and the second fled. Suzuki-san honored us with his personal gratitude and an original Kuichi Li portrait of Yu Yu Matsuda.
56410
Beef Farm Knocked Out
56411
STUTTGART — A Luxury Foods farm was put out of commission by an LWB operative’s bomb that exploded near the main generator. Some Synth Foods employees were killed in the blast, many others wounded. The bomber was none other than Karl Furgen, the previous owner of the plantation, who faked his own death to join the LWB when he realized that he would soon be bought out by the Liberty corporation. Furgen was able to escape and is currently planning his next attack in Darmstadt.
56412
Synth Foods Slowly Gaining Ground
56413
STUTTGART — Though the LWB has been fighting Synth Foods steadily for several decades now, the fight has grown more difficult to protect our homeland from the imperialistic invaders. Soon 80 percent of Stuttgart will be in the hands of Synth, and the climate has already been irrevocably changed. This is not a call for surrender, but a renewal of will against the accursed Liberty corporation. The steps we have been taking to stop the foreign company are not enough; we must intensify pressure to free our lands.
56414
A Century of Strife
56415
DARMSTADT — LWB leaders are planning a massive strike on Synth Food operations next week on the one-hundredth anniversary of the Liberty company’s invasion of Stuttgart. The details of the plan have not yet been released, but LWB veterans have been warned to be available for a large-scale operation. This plan only includes members of the LWB whose family had land taken from them by Synth Foods, since the risk factor is rumored to be very high. Next week will be one of great importance for our small band of freedom fighters.
56416
Biodome Knocked Out in Deshima
56417
SHIKOKU — Farmers Alliance commandos planted a bomb in the biodome in Deshima several days ago. Both operatives were able to escape before the timer went off. According to reports, the dome will not produce food for several weeks. This is a symbolic victory for the Alliance. There is no place for a Synth Foods biodome in Kusari space, and soon the foreigners will come to learn that fact. The injuries caused by the explosion are regrettable, yet necessary when compared to the terrible price that the people of Kusari will pay if the Liberty corporation takes over.
56418
Alliance Enjoys Strong Support
56419
KYUSHU — A poll recently taken by an independent news group found that the Farmers Alliance is very popular among a large portion of the Kyushu populace. Obviously, Alliance propaganda is taking effect in the minds and hearts of the people of the system. Our organization enjoys particular support from the older, wiser generations living on the planet. Soon people will begin to realize that it was a mistake to let foreigners come into our space. It will not be long before the Farmers Alliance movement is sweeping through the empire.
56420
Kyushu Rice is Healthiest Choice
56421
NEW TOKYO — Though many complain of the higher price that comes with Kyushu foods, they do not think of the benefits their bodies are receiving from eating naturally grown foods. A recent study conducted by an independent organization discovered that Synth Paste can damage a person’s long-term health and cause hair loss. The synthetic swill they pump from their biodomes is chiefly chemicals and dye. Remember to tell people this information when they complain about the prices of our foods, because you cannot place a price on good health.
56422
Life is Good in New York
56423
BUFFALO — New York has the best that life has to offer for a criminal in Liberty. Here in the center of Sirius, one can travel through the system aided by the numerous debris fields. Additionally, the Badlands hide Buffalo from the prying eyes of the military and the LPI. Everything is provided for those that have the guts to take it. Cardamine and loot are readily available, and if you get captured by the LPI, then room and board are free. If a Bounty Hunter pops you, then you aren’t feeling any pain anyway.
56424
The LPI Steps it up in Pittsburgh
56425
PITTSBURGH — Rogues have been encountering more patrols than usual near Pittsburgh these days. If you decide to do some hunting in that area, be careful and stay hidden in the Pittsburgh fields as much as possible. Junker sources believe that the increased patrols are due to LPI’s recent “Get Tough on Crime” campaign that they have been waging against the party crowd in Liberty. LPI pilots are getting paid bonuses to bring us in, so they are going deeper into the debris than they normally do.
56426
Largest Cardamine Haul Ever
56427
ALCATRAZ — Rogue pilots recently smuggled a large shipment of Cardamine from California all the way to the Junkers at Rochester in New York. “Things got a little tense when we realized that we were being ghosted by a couple of Hunters, but we managed to get away from them — Woohoo!” cried Terry Donovan, one of the successful smugglers.
56428
New Recruits to Receive Training
56429
ALCATRAZ — Leaders from around Liberty came together in California this week to discuss the possibility of training newer Rogue members to become better pilots and smugglers. “If we could take the acquired knowledge of our more experienced members and share it with some of the scrubs, then we’d have fewer casualties among our junior members,” said Montezuma chief, Nick Creeley. This is all part of a Rogue effort everywhere to try and become a more effective force within Liberty and Sirius.
56430
Xenos Get Hammered By Unioners
56431
DAWSON — It looks like some of the Xenos in this system lost a pretty big fight with the Rheinland Unioners last week. Everybody knows that the Xenos are trying to get in on the Diamond trade — so far unsuccessfully. The case was no different this time when four Xenos attacked Unioners heading through the Wrangell Field towards Dawson to do some Diamond trading. Rogue pilots held back and watched as the Xenos got torn apart by the more experienced Unioner pilots.
56432
No Bounties for these Hunters
56433
KENAI FIELD — A small flight of Bounty Hunters was ambushed by Rogue pilots just south of the Kenai fields yesterday as they completed a circuit of the area. Rogue patrols had been ghosting the three novice Hunters for about a week as they searched the system to collect bounties on Rogue scalps. Yesterday the trap was laid and sprung. A force of seven Rogues destroyed all three Bounty Hunter ships. The action is an example of the organization and teamwork that Rogues have been attempting to instill within the membership lately.
56434
Lane Hacker Information Pays Off
56435
MONTEZUMA — The intelligence purchased from Lane Hackers has more than paid for itself within the past several months in Cortez. Looted Luxury Good shipments from New York have been earning the majority of the money at the base. Once the cargo is acquired, Rogue smugglers make their way back to New York, where the goods are fenced to the Junkers at excellent prices. Unfortunately, this lucrative cycle may be nearing its end since the Luxury Goods shipments are entering the system with more and more escorts. Soon they will not be worth the price paid in pilots and ships.
56436
Fight Like the Outcasts
56437
MONTEZUMA — Rogue leaders aboard Dawson are attempting to convince Outcast smugglers on their way into Liberty space to train our own pilots. This initiative was created at the Rogue Chief meetings held in California recently. If the Outcasts are willing to share their knowledge of combat, gunnery, and piloting in return for favors and money, Rogue combat effectiveness should skyrocket. As of yet, no Outcasts have been willing, but leaders remain optimistic that an arrangement can be made.
56438
Rogues Suffer a Loss to Kusari
56439
RAIDEN CLOUD — High-value Kusari goods will be entering Liberty soon, despite efforts by pilots from Padua. Rogues attempted to waylay an armored transport in the Trade Lanes just west of the Raiden Cloud. The ship’s defenses and escorts proved to be too much for the outgunned Rogue force, and after the loss of three of our men and their ships, the remaining members of the raiding party broke off the attack and limped back home. This is discouraging news, but we will come back from this experience stronger than ever.
56440
Close Call with Liberty Military
56441
PADUA — Two Rogues are recovering from injuries tonight in Padua after an encounter with a military patrol almost cost them their lives. The two were transporting Artifacts on behalf of the Outcasts when they were jumped by two military flights running a circuit from Colorado. The smugglers were caught at their most vulnerable point: halfway between the Komatsu and the Reppu Clouds. Luckily, the pilots were able to make it to the Reppu Cloud and escape, although their ships were badly damaged. They also managed to save the Artifacts, which will be smuggled into New York next week.
56442
Food Shortages a Thing of the Past
56443
CRETE — The Family Elders of Crete are discussing plans regarding the construction of biodomes. If successful, Corsairs would never have to worry about the Food shortages that have plagued our people for the 800 years since we were cast upon Crete. In recent years, famine has not been a major issue for the Corsairs due to the wealth brought in from the Artifact trade and piracy. But the problem would be completely alleviated with the addition of biodomes, which could sustain the entire population for a fraction of the price now required.
56444
The Bounty Hunter Scourge
56445
CRETE — Many Corsairs believe that it is no longer necessary to tolerate the Zoner presence in Omicron Gamma’s sister system. There is concern that they allow Bounty Hunters to come too close to the homeworld. It has also been argued that the biodomes in Freeport 9 could be salvaged after the Zoner expulsion and used to grow food solely for Corsairs. Right now, the Zoners enjoy relative safety in Omicron Theta, but that could soon change.
56446
Rivera Returns from Sigma-19
56447
CRETE — Elder Rivera has returned from his negotiations with the Hogosha in Hawaii. The GMG will no longer be included in the sale of any Artifacts to the Kusari crime syndicate, which means more profits for the Corsairs. Toruella also finalized several other contracts with the Hogosha in preparation for the upcoming months. “I am pleased to announce that everything has gone as planned,” Rivera admitted upon his arrival back in Corsair space. “The Hogosha will back us completely for direct access to our Artifacts.”
56448
New Advances in Ship Technology
56449
TRIPOLI — Centuries of reverse engineering and building fighter crafts from the remnants of salvaged ships have paid off yet again. Tripoli engineers discovered a new way to fine-tune the H-Fuel intake components on a star drive, yielding much greater power than the original Kishiro designers thought possible. This latest discovery will allow any Corsair ship with the same engine to increase its speed by at least 50 percent after stabilizers are added to the ship’s hull and engine mountings.
56450
Troops Pulled from the Front
56451
CADIZ — Soldiers and pilots are being rotated back to Crete from the front in the following weeks. A full squadron of fighters and a company of marines will maintain a holding presence in Cadiz, but the rest are headed back for new orders. Most of the pilots headed back to Omicron Gamma are glad to be getting out of the system, but the generals have alerted the men and women remaining at Cadiz that they will assume a defensive position against the Hessians for several months, a move that should significantly reduce casualties.

Every Corsair’s Duty
56453
LEON — The Elders wish to remind the Corsairs of Leon that they must continue with raids upon Bretonia, concentrating specifically upon the Gold shipments in Dublin and New London. “Men and women of Leon, though you are not currently serving at military grade, you must strive to make sure that the body of our nation remains fed and armed. I task you, my children, to go out into the stars and bring back their fire,” commands the High Elder Montoya. Keep the supplies coming in from Bretonia.

The Road To Rheinland Part I
56455
CRETE — The war of attrition in Omega-5 is costing us too many lives and ships in a fruitless struggle to gain control of the southern Border Worlds. The Elders have decided upon a new strategy to destroy the Red Hessians once and for all. Forces from Cadiz will be redeployed to Crete, where they will rearm and prepare for a northern assault into Rheinland. Once this is done the new Northern Fleet will move up to Sigma-19, and after we are in position, we shall commence an attack on the Junkers in Sigma-13.
56456
The Road To Rheinland Part II
56457
CRETE — The Hogosha has agreed to use their contacts in Kusari to put focused pressure upon the Outcasts, alleviating the possibility of a flank attack by our northern enemies. In return, the Hogosha will be given exclusive Artifacts-distribution rights for all of Sirius. The Junkers at Sigma-13 cannot withstand a focused attack and will fall. The Northern Fleet will then invade Frankfurt, where we should encounter minimal resistance from the Bundschuh or the Rheinland Federal Police. As soon as Frankfurt falls, a base of operations will be established there and lines drawn for the push into Dresden.
56458
The Road To Rheinland Part III
56459
CRETE — The Northern Fleet in Frankfurt will stage an all-out attack on the Red Hessians in Dresden. Once Hessian forces are pulled from Omega-11 and Omega-5 to counter the Northern Fleet’s assault, conscripted forces from Leon and the standing fleet in Cadiz will launch into the two weakened Omega systems. When victory is achieved in the Omegas, the Leon fleet will attack the Hessians in Dresden from behind, and the hammer will meet the anvil. The Cadiz Fleet will stand by to reinforce and protect the flank.

Don Teofilo Dies of Natural Causes
56461
MALTA — One of the oldest and most respected cartel dons has passed away at the age of 177. Teofilo Wenceslau died in his sleep at his plantation yesterday surrounded by his closest family members. Wenceslau was the oldest man in Outcast history, having outlived the next eldest by twelve years. Though the Cardamine mutation has lowered birth rates among our race, a positive effect has been the dramatic increase in the average lifespan, which is currently 124. Teofilo is survived by his eldest daughter, Dona Alicia, who will now assume command of the Wenceslau cartel.

Benitez takes Control of Solano
56463
MALTA — Miguel Benitez rules the most powerful cartel in Outcast space after acquiring the Solano Plantation last month. The Toruella and Velez cartels have also pledged their loyalty to the Benitez family, in a surprise move that guarantees his ascension to Head Don of the Outcasts. Benitez’s primary rival, Don David of the Narvaez cartel, has decided not to oppose Benitez when he assumes leadership of the families of Malta.

Our Purgatory Becomes a Paradise
56465
MALTA — With the enormous influx of money into the Outcast economy, Malta is slowly being transformed into rolling fields of tall orange grasses and luxuriant towns and cities. Almost the entire population is involved in the Cardamine trade, and there is so much profit to make that even field hands are living in a style only those in the capital systems are accustomed to. Slowly, the Outcasts have built a paradise from the bitter soils and rocky crags of this planet.

IMG Base Location Still a Mystery
56467
MALTA — Interrogators did not have a chance to unlock any information regarding the location of the secret IMG base in Tau-37. The captured miner, who was traveling through the Edge Worlds towards the hidden base, died from injuries he sustained while trying to escape the Outcast patrol that caught him unawares. “It is a pity that he was so badly injured. We didn’t even get a chance to begin interrogating him before he died,” said security officer Jose Rubiera. Outcasts continue searching for the elusive miners.

RUIZ — Yesterday Outcast patrols intercepted and destroyed a small GMG survey ship convoy that was launching retrievable probes into the alien organics fields northeast of the Jump Hole to Sigma-19. This is the fifth incursion into the system by the GMG in as five months. A reprisal attack against GMG operations in the Border Worlds was ordered and launched. Our fighters returned to base after destroying a mining ship and killing at least a dozen miners in the Hiryu Cloud.

Outcast Raiding Fleet to be Updated
56471
MALTA — Engineers are revamping 100 ships per month over the next two years to make the Raiders even more deadly than they already are. Master engineer Ibrahim Casse has developed a new design that will be implemented on the fleet. Casse’s 100+ years of experience as an engineer makes him the finest ship designer and builder in all of Sirius. His academy builds new prototypes every semester as he trains a new generation to follow in his footsteps.

Benitez Calls Upon all Outcasts
56473
MALTA — Don Miguel Benitez called upon Outcasts throughout Sirius to help him locate his missing son. Benitez even summoned Santiago Llorens, who was in Liberty conducting business. Llorens responded to the call by returning to Malta. Benitez’s third eldest son, who has been missing for some time, sent a distress call from the Sigma Border Worlds two days ago. “I ask that all Outcasts use their powers and talents to find my son, whose safe return will bring a six million credit reward,” offered Don Miguel.

Cardamine Profits Run Higher
56475
MALTA — Cartels across the planet are celebrating tonight after quarterly Cardamine profits were registered. “The criminals that distribute the Cardamine are accounting for a significant portion of total profits,” said Jorge Garcia, a profits estimator, “and the popularity that Cardamine is experiencing among the wealthiest citizens of the House systems is soaring.” With the introduction of Cardamine into Kusari — thanks to the efforts of the Golden Chrysanthemums — plantation growers are enjoying their highest profits ever recorded. Many believe that this is a critical transition point for Cardamine and project that a quarter of all Sirius will be addicted to the drug by the end of the decade.
56476
The Golden C. Is Addicted
56477
CALI — It appears that the Kusari terrorist organization, the Golden Chrysanthemums, has become completely dependent upon Cardamine. Outcast observers were able to ascertain that the Golden C. is even using the drug as part of several of their high-level ceremonies. “I believe that they will be even more obedient than the Liberty Rogues, given time,” said observer Javier Soto. The organization is perfect for distribution because it has its finger on the pulse of the Kusari youth.

Docking Ring
60208
A docking ring is a piece of orbiting technology that, through the use of super strong crystalline polymers and frictionless bearings, assists the smooth atmospheric entry of any interstellar vessel that can land. Invented in 130 AS by Ageira Technologies, these ‘orbital elevators’ almost completely negate the cost of boosting people or materials out of a planetary gravity well. Docking rings revolutionized exploration and industry almost overnight, opening up entire systems for commercial exploration and exploitation.\n\nAgeira Technologies licenses this technology to the other houses, who in turn agree to design all ships (except for special exploratory and survey vessels), to work with the docking ring system.\n\nWARNING: Do not approach a planet and attempt a landing without using the docking ring.
60209
Jump Gate
60210
A jump gate is a conveyance technology that allows instantaneous travel between two distinct points in space using technology pioneered by Ageira Technologies and built by Deep Space Engineering in 130 AS. According to the annual Ageira Technologies Shareholder Report, ‘jump gate technology is designed to gather and amplify certain permeable tendencies in real-space and connect them to other congruent points elsewhere in the sector, while still maintaining the structural integrity and stability of the channel created by this process and of the object passing through it.’\n\nAgeira Technologies and Deep Space Engineering continue to survey other potential jump point candidates and expect to provide connections with other areas further and further away as their research continues.
60211
Jump Hole
60212
***GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALY DETECTED***\nMagnetic and gravimetric readings consistent with a ‘jump hole’.\n\nLike jump gates, jump holes are semi-permeable areas in real space that tend to breach the natural boundaries of linear time and space. Unlike jump gates, though, these anomalies occur naturally and so are both unpredictable and unstable. Traveling through jump holes is a risky proposition at best. Though some have been charted and, based on accounts from ships that have accidentally encountered them, have had their exit points logged, just as many ships have never been heard from again. It is believed that these ships were either crushed in the violent, cataclysmic vortex that lies outside the narrow corridor of a jump tunnel, or were sent to a place far enough away to make communication or a return trip infeasible. In either case, those missing are presumed dead. Ageira Technologies and Deep Space Engineering urge all citizens to use the prescribed trade lanes and jump gates and to avoid all contact with jump holes.

Trade Lane Ring
60246
Trade lanes are used for superluminal travel within a system. Trade lanes must be entered from their origin point, usually located near key industrial, military, or civilian bases.\n\nThe first trade lane was established through a joint venture between Deep Space Engineering and Ageira Technologies in the year 280 AS. By 350 AS, most of Liberty space was crisscrossed by trade lanes. Through financing from Interspace Commerce, the trade lane network was rapidly extended into the other colonies, helping to create a truly sector-wide economy. Trade lanes are the fastest and safest method of transporting goods and personnel within and between the colonies. Plans to expand the trade lanes to connect interests in the independent territories outside of the colonies are pending.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>The history of the Unioners is intimately tied to Alster. The shipyard opened in 412 AS, specializing in commercial transports and heavy lifters. Conditions were appalling in the yards, worker safety being merely a tertiary concern of the owners. Coupled with the excessively long spaceside rotations, the workers’ morale gradually deteriorated until a major accident killed several hundred workers in 512 AS.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Three months later, the workers formed the Alster Union. Because of their highly specialized skills, the management had no choice but to capitulate to their demands. During the next century, the union gradually strengthened and eventually included the dockworkers on the Altona Station above Hamburg. By the end of the Eighty Years’ War, the union demanded increasingly high wages and progressively fewer annual hours. The system was out of balance. Republican was no longer competitive with Kusari shipbuilders.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>With the war over, demand for ships plummeted. The bloated headcount of Alster was now a sore point for Republican Shipping, desperately trying to restore profitability. Management was now back in the driver’s seat after almost 200 years of acceding to union demands. They fired tens of thousands and won major concessions from the remaining workers, who lost centuries of gains in a matter of days.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>As unemployment rocketed towards 30 percent in Hamburg, a radicalized version of the union reformed — more of a revolutionary cell than anything. The presence of Freeport 2 in Bering proved alluring to the nascent Unioner movement of Rheinland during the unsettled times. Following the popular uprising of 702, the station’s population exploded. In 720 the Zoners laid down the ultimatum: Take your criminal activities somewhere else. They would sell basic supplies to the rebels, but no more. So the Unioners carved their Pacifica base out of an asteroid in the Tanner Belt.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Unioners range from Bering to New Berlin. Most of their attacks are focused on the Altona Outpost and the Alster Shipyard in Hamburg, which has alienated them from some of their still employed brethren. The bulk of their Trade Lane raids are directed against Republican ships traversing the Independent Worlds. Their main commodity is Diamonds, which they run from Kreuzberg to Dawson.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>The story of the Hessians emerges from the turbulent history of the Dresden System, the mining heartland of Rheinland since the beginning of the third century. Mining there was dirty, dangerous work, but Daumann and Krüger had little reason to lose sleep over the welfare of their employees. The price of the occasional disability pension or life insurance policy was nothing compared to the money made from extracting and refining the metals and materials that fed the Rheinland industry.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>As the Eighty Years’ War wound down to its ignoble conclusion, Rheinland found itself virtually bankrupt. Krüger and Daumann released thousands of employees throughout Rheinland. Promises of bonuses were left unfulfilled, and in many cases, miners were left completely destitute. An uprising was almost inevitable. A group of miners took control of the Daumann Heavy Construction facility on Von Rohe’s Day in 700 AS.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The revolt soon spread from Dresden to the rest of the Rheinland, gaining widespread backing from the legions of newly unemployed workers. The industrial heart of Rheinland stopped beating; the Popular Revolution had begun.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Within five months a new coalition government was established. Both Krüger and Daumann were required to pay reparations, and all Rheinland companies were forced to comply with a newly ratified Workers’ Rights Convention. They have been careful to adhere to the letter of the law, if not the spirit. The compromise left many that had fought in the revolution bitter. Many workers could not accept the prospect of working for their old taskmasters and decided to form the Red Hessians, a group dedicated to destroying the two companies.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>It was not long before Red Hessian political ideals were replaced by greed, which has led them to become more like pirates than activists. The police have been forced to maintain a significant presence in Dresden to prevent Hessian strikes from clogging the gears of the Rheinland industry.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Hessians have gradually expanded, assisted by their close proximity to Stuttgart Food shipments and an extensive Jump Hole network within the southern Sirius Sector. They now own a string of bases in the southern Rheinland Border Worlds. In Omega-5 they encountered their first real obstacle — the Corsairs. They have fought the Edge World faction to a tenuous stalemate, with the Ronneburg base barely holding on against the stronger Corsair presence in that system. Fortunately, they live in a rich area of Sirius in terms of raw materials, especially Diamonds. Their preferred targets are Daumann and Krüger, although almost any shipper is vulnerable to attack.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>The history of the Mollys is intimately linked with that of Dublin. During the height of the Dublin Gold rush, the field manager in charge of the primary large-scale corporate operation in the system was a ruthless tyrant named Sir Edmund Graves. Graves pushed the miners to the limit in the name of profits, causing many unnecessary deaths. Greed combined with absolute control had proved too tempting. He and his lieutenants began skimming a percentage off the Gold take every week.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The miners were pushed harder to cover up the shortfall in shipments back to New London, and the situation became critical. The Founders Day Revolt, as it came to be known, occurred on the annual national Bretonian holiday in 752 AS that commemorated the original founding of New London centuries before. The workers mutinied, executed Graves and his compatriots, and took control of the mining ships Endeavor and Glorious.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Bretonian military response was swift and furious. Bretonian gunboats arrived shortly, and in the ensuing battle, destroyed the Endeavor and its mutineers. They pursued the Glorious across the system into a dense field, where they stumbled into a large, explosive booby trap set by the fleeing miners. One gunboat was destroyed; several were damaged.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Battleship </TEXT><TRA italic="true"/><TEXT>Hood</TEXT><TRA italic="false"/><TEXT>  was rushed in from New London to restore order.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Soon after tourists began to arrive in Edinburgh in 690 AS, Cambridge scientists voiced their concern over the enormous ecological damage that even the most regulated visits could inflict on the planet. Almost from birth Cantabrigians had drilled into them the stories of how New London and Leeds were blighted, so they tended to be very environmentally sensitive. A few of the younger and more militant scientists studying on Edinburgh actually went so far as to begin a campaign to sabotage tourist transports to discourage visits, but with little effect.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Once Cobalt was discovered on Gaia in 740, the BMM began to make noises in New London about the need to establish a mining base there. What had been a quiet, bloodless campaign of active resistance blossomed into a full-fledged conflict. Graffiti with slogans such as “GAIA WILL NOT BLEED” was spotted soon after. The eco-terrorist movement had begun.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Eventually any plans to mine the surface of Edinburgh were dropped — mostly out of fear that it might cut into the burgeoning tourist industry — but the Gaians had already broadened their horizons by an influx of radical elements from Cambridge who sought a ban on terraforming technologies. Planetform, Inc. was the natural target. What emerged was a militant terrorist group philosophically opposed to the exploitation of planets, and terraforming in particular. The group enjoyed considerable popular support on Cambridge, funded by the efforts of the legitimate arm of the Gaians called the Green Front.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>While the Gaians and the eco-terrorist movement as a whole have made little progress outside of Bretonian space, Green Front propaganda is a common sight in Bretonia. Green Front commentators are often present on the news, and unlike the Mollys, a certain amount of tolerance for them exists in the government from those disinclined to antagonize their Cambridge connections. Over the years, the movement has broadened considerably until the majority of its sympathizers are environmentally conscious individuals from throughout Bretonia.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The sole Gaian base lies deep within the Islay Ice Cloud at the northeastern edge of the Edinburgh System. From here, the eco-terrorists coordinate attacks on their enemies within Bretonia space and the Tau-31 system. Occasionally, raids are made on the center of all evil — Planetform, Inc. headquarters at the Canterbury Station in the New London System.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Believed to be founded by a group of New Berlin University students in 679 AS, the movement had much support among the liberal elite of New Berlin, tired of the corrupt practices of the government that had led them to financial ruin near the end of the Eighty Years’ War. During the Dresden rebellion of 700 AS, the Bundschuh found their first official cause — shipping supplies “liberated” from Frankfurt to the Krüger and Daumann rebels. Three months after that, sympathetic maintenance workers started sabotaging Daumann’s manufacturing operations in New Berlin. The industrial heart of Rheinland stopped beating, and the Popular Revolution had begun.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Five years later the Emperor was overthrown, and a new coalition government was established in its place. While the Bundschuh initially pushed for a full investigation into the activities of companies such as Krüger Minerals and Daumann Heavy Construction, more pragmatic elements within the government decided that for the newly formed Rheinland Republic to succeed, it needed the support of the aristocrats who controlled those and other major companies. Both Krüger and Daumann were eventually required to pay substantial reparations intended to “improve the Rheinland Republic for the good of all people,” and all Rheinland companies were forced to comply with a newly ratified Workers’ Rights Convention.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>By 715 AS business in Dresden had more or less resumed as usual. The Bundschuh was driven underground, an impractical brand of idealism ill-suited to building a consensus among the many different government factions and the aristocrats who controlled the purse strings. The Bundschuh took the ideological high route, attracting the purists dedicated to overthrowing the corrupt Rheinland regime represented by the government, Daumann, and Republican. The Red Hessians adapted the more pragmatic approach of stealing and plundering in the guise of fighting the powers that be. As a result, the Red Hessian ranks swelled, and the Bundschuh dwindled.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Bundschuh have always looked to the Unioners, LWB, Red Hessians, and disgruntled Republican, Daumann, and Krüger workers for possible recruits. So they maintain a distinct note of neutrality towards the criminal groups, although they find the Red Hessian practice of indiscriminate piracy distasteful. They prefer to focus on Daumann, Republican, and military bases, although they do raid a ship on occasion for supplies, preferably Samura or Kishiro, as they have no more love for Kusari than the rest of the Rheinland.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Kyushu is often referred to as the Samura “company” planet within Kusari, as so many of its inhabitants depend on Samura’s continued largess. As part of an effort to stimulate rice production on Kyushu, Samura gradually organized the Kyushu farmers into cooperatives that would buy Fertilizer and customized seeds from their laboratories in New Tokyo. Consumers paid exorbitant amounts for the rice produced, which everyone swore was much higher quality than that produced in any other part of Kusari, and thus worth the premium price it fetched in Samura’s New Tokyo supermarkets.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>With the eventual introduction of Trade Lanes, Kusari farmers were opened to competition with the rest of the Sirius Sector. They lobbied the government heavily, financed with Samura money, which had the most to lose from cheaper foreign competitors. The government acquiesced for several centuries, leading to astronomical Kusari Food prices. Eventually, under pressure from the Liberty government, Kusari reopened the agricultural imports market, despite intense lobbying by Samura.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Synth Foods moved in and became an overnight success, opening franchises in the urban areas of Honshu and New Tokyo. Demand for expensive Kyushu Food dropped, and many independent farmers were forced out of business. Feeling betrayed, some of the farmers proceeded to organize the Farmers Alliance, a militant group that lobbies for “farmers’ rights” — which include such things as government subsidies and restrictions on the sale of foreign foods in Kusari. In fact, the Farmers Alliance generally is opposed to foreign influence of any kind, particularly the Trade Lanes that have so damaged their livelihoods.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The general population ignores the Farmers Alliance for the most part, though they do have some support among older Kusari citizens. In reality, The Farmers Alliance is little more than a puppet of Samura, who wishes to return to its Food and trade monopoly days. Samura uses them for much of its dirty work, attacking foreign shippers, Synth Foods, and even Kishiro on occasion. The Farmers Alliance likes the Hogosha, as they represent the traditional “criminals” of Kusari that fit in with society. They abhor the Golden Chrysanthemums and their disgusting drug habit. The Blood Dragons are also viewed with suspicion since whatever Samura says is the truth.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

Despite the pollution resulting from years of industrialization, the vast majority of the Bretonian aristocracy lives here, and even the most impoverished citizen is comfortably middle class. Most of the population works in the Bretonian bureaucratic aristocracy, an almost impenetrable network of obscure titles, government offices, and rules of procedure.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>The Rogues are a product of over two centuries of systematic lower-class cleansing that occurred on the Liberty planets of Manhattan, Denver, and Los Angeles. Relocated to the Texas prison system, many of them end up planetside on Houston upon release. Some stayed straight and joined the population scratching out a living. The rest returned to their life of crime, often ending up vaporized by a pursuing Liberty police patrol or back in prison for longer stretches, manning the prison factories that are the economic lifeblood of the Texas System.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Some say the massive LPI roundups of even minor offenders in Liberty have more to do with staffing these plants cheaply than reducing crime. Fresh out of the incubator of the Texas prison system, they have limited choices. Either they work in the factories of Houston for a pittance, join the Bounty Hunters and hunt down their former brethren, go radical and hook up with the Xenos, or rejoin their former partners in crime. The latter path is the obvious one for most. Simply put, these are not-too-quick opportunists, people willing to do whatever it takes to make a buck and get by until tomorrow. Usually, they end up taking the fall for anything illegal that occurs in Liberty, whether they were involved or not.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Rogues are generally a disorganized lot.

They also provide shelter for the Outcasts in exchange for Cardamine. Recently they have become the smugglers for much of the Cardamine in Liberty space, supplementing or even replacing the Outcasts on certain high-risk routes. This has made them accomplices to the most persecuted criminal group in Liberty space. They admire the Outcasts, wishing they could be as smart and careful as the Edge World faction.

A Junker will double-cross you without a second thought, and they’re fiercely protective of each other. Most House corporations consider the Junkers to be simple criminals, but Junkers will occasionally do favors for the police, turning in the odd, mid-level criminal or letting them know about the occasional drug shipment. So despite some harassment, the police stop short of shutting them down. The infrequent police cleanup operations are little more than exercises in public relations, though there’s no love lost between the two groups.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Junkers make their official money from salvaging debris within the fields, but also have a good deal going with various criminals, who like their “no questions asked” policy.

131934
<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>The Oxygen is mostly used for the terraforming machines, which run around the clock. Their purpose is twofold: to increase Oxygen content in the air around the base, and to introduce various atmosphere-forming gases like carbon dioxide and nitrogen into the atmosphere. We still have at least fifty years before this operation is completed.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Some time ago Planetform discovered that the Alien Organisms found in the Edge Nebula systems had very high reproductive rates, and could exist in quite hostile conditions. One of their primary functions is to dissolve the carbonate rocks found in abundance here, releasing elemental oxygen and carbon dioxide in the process.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Most of our Water is hauled in from Freeport 4 in the Magellan system.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Liberty has been quite accommodating to our needs. We certainly haven’t had to contend with anything like the Gaians. They are more pragmatic here.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Most of our Gas produced here is shipped to Osaka by Samura, although that will be changing shortly. Supplies are brought in from our Aomori base in the Honshu system.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>You must be careful of the oxygen pockets within Sigma-13. Many ships have stumbled unawares into these dangerous traps over the years. They are interesting phenomena created when an oxygen pocket is protected from the surrounding hydrogen-rich clouds by a shell of inert helium. When a ship enters the area, its engines emit hydrogen that reacts explosively with the surrounding oxygen.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Samura has betrayed our trust. We made a pact with them centuries ago to simplify the sale and transport of our Gas. They have abused and exploited that agreement.

133012
<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Our ancestors are Kusari fishermen that were forced to leave Honshu in the second century after the fishing stocks became severely depleted.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Samura once dominated gas miner technology, but as in many other areas, we have been complacent and let Kishiro pass us by.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>We have been contracted by the Rheinland and Kusari governments to remove the debris remaining from the Eighty Years’ War battlefields.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>ALG was reluctant to take this job, but the contract was quite lucrative. It is eerie dismantling all of these tombs of Rheinland sailors.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>ALG would like to see better relations between Rheinland and Kusari; that’s why we agreed to this job.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>It’s a lonely job out in this station. ALG does not ship across any other Border World areas. I’ve seen Corsairs and Outcasts in the area.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>ALG is a very progressive company that treats its workers properly. We don’t expose them to excessive danger like Daumann.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>This is a very convenient exchange location for us. There’s no exposure to house military or police, and it’s not far from home — so we don’t develop withdrawal symptoms like on the Bretonia-Liberty runs. The GMG is a little annoying, but we can manage.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

On that fateful day, he flew into the Donryu Cloud and was never heard from again. It is assumed that he finally met his match out there in Outcast territory, a fitting end for a Guild ace.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

We’ve been keeping a close watch on %F0v1 recently. 
327782
We’ve been keeping a close watch on %F0v1 recently. 
327783
Our most recent scans of %Z0v1 uncovered something very interesting. 
327784
We found %I0v1 and %I1v1 in a previously empty area. Your mission is to mount a quick surgical strike to remove this new threat. 
327785
Surveillance indicates that %F0v1 is up to something. 
327786
Surveillance indicates that %F0v1 are up to something. 
327787
Our analysts have scanned %Z0v1 and have found something suspicious. 
327788
We believe they are building what appears to be %I0v1 there. We can’t allow that to continue. Your mission is to fly there and put a stop to their operation. 
327789
Our scouts have informed us that more territory has fallen under the influence of %F0v1. 
327790
Our scouts have informed us that more territory has fallen under the influence of %F0v1. 
327791
A new base of theirs has recently been spotted in %Z0v1. We want it removed. 
327792
Your mission is to make your way to that area and eliminate %I0v2 you will find there. Understand, your primary objective is their installation, not %I1v2. 
327793
Recon has discovered a small installation run by %F0v1. 
327794
Recon has discovered a small installation run by %F0v1. 
327795
Currently, it consists of %I0v1. 
327796
Despite its significance, this is far too minor a target for us to trifle with. However, we are looking for a third party willing to travel to %Z0v1 to deal with this problem for us. 
327797
Upon successful destruction of all targets, we will compensate this third party with %d0 credits. 
327798
One more thing, we also want you to eliminate all %F0v2 ships you encounter on your mission. 
327799
It is entirely your option to eliminate whatever hostile contacts you may encounter. Even if you do not, your compensation is assured with the completion of your main objective. 
327800
A more detailed scan hasn’t revealed any %F0v2 ships near their installation, so this may be a clean go. 
327801
We have already dispatched a wing of ships to %Z0v1. Meet up with them and they will assist you. 
327802
Once you’ve engaged %F0v1, we will send in other units for support. 
327803
Be advised that we can’t spare any other pilots to help you, so this will be a solo mission. 
327804
We have tracked down the wanted criminal, %s0 %s1. 
327805
This menace’s last known location was in %Z0v1. 
327806
Find him, destroy his ship, and tractor in his %L0v1. 
327807
Once it’s secured in your cargo hold, bring it back to %B so we can deal with him appropriately. 
327808
It appears there’s been a lot of activity from %F0v1 lately. 
327809
It appears there’s been a lot of activity from %F0v1 lately. 
327810
We’ve singled out one of their operatives, %s0 %s1. 
327811
It appears he is transporting %L0v2 in his ship. We are willing to pay to have him intercepted. 
327812
You are directed to destroy his ship and tractor in %L0v3. 
327813
We have reports that our old friend %s0 %s1 is up to some new tricks. 
327814
His ties to %F0v1 are apparently as strong as ever. 
327815
His ties to %F0v1 are apparently as strong as ever. 
327816
He recently acquired %L0v2 from an unnamed source. This is unacceptable to us. 
327817
Your mission is to find him and destroy %L0v3 at all costs. 
327818
We have tolerated %F0v1 long enough. 
327819
We have tolerated %F0v1 long enough. 
327820
One of their more active leaders, %s0 %s1, has been spotted. 
327821
He was last seen in %Z0v1 and we have reason to believe he’s still there. 
327822
You are hereby authorized to track him down and assassinate him. With his termination, perhaps they will learn some respect for %F0v1. 
327823
You are hereby authorized to track him down and assassinate him. With his termination, perhaps they will learn some respect for %F0v1. 
327824
Move cautiously however, we believe that %I0v1 may be operating in the area. 
327825
A group of %F0v2 ships has been spotted. 
327826
A group of %F0v2 ships has been spotted. 
327827
We think they’re still in %Z0v1 where they were last seen. This is a simple housecleaning mission; get out there and make the area safe again. 
327828
We also understand that in addition to these ships there may be %I0v1 operating nearby. 
327829
In advance of your accepting this mission, we took the liberty of sending out some people to get the ball rolling. 
327830
In any case, once you’ve made it out there you will be joined by some of our ships, who will then act as your support. 
327831
We will dispatch a wing of our ships to %Z0v1 to assist you as soon as we can. Until then you will be solo on this one. 
327832
We’re being pressured by attacks from %F0v1. 
327833
We’re being pressured by attacks from %F0v1. 
327834
Our own sources have found they are attacking from %I0v1 and %I1v1. 
327835
Your job is to fly out to %Z0v1 and take them out — completely. 
327836
It appears %F0v1 has been very busy lately. 
327837
It appears %F0v1 have been very busy lately. 
327838
We’ve discovered that they’re building %I0v1. 
327839
We cannot afford for this to reach completion. Please fly to %Z0v1 and take care of this matter discreetly. 
327840
We’ve been informed that %F0v1 has just built a new installation. 
327841
We’ve been informed that the %F0v1 have just built a new installation. 
327842
This move in %Z0v1 now threatens our interests. 
327843
We want you to fly out there and destroy %I0v2. However, do not concern yourself with %I1v2, that is merely an obstacle. Your main goal is their base. 
327844
We have discovered a new %F0v2 presence. 
327845
We have discovered a new %F0v2 presence. 
327846
They have set up a new base in %Z0v1. 
327847
This is of some concern, but rather than undertake an expensive operation just to remove %I0v1, we are looking for a third party to help our cause. 
327848
We are offering %d0 credits for its removal. 
327849
Needless to say, we would also want you to terminate any and all %F0v2 ships you may come in contact with. 
327850
Naturally, you may eliminate any hostiles you may encounter in the service of your mission. However, don’t be concerned if you stay expressly to task, since you’ll be paid just the same. 
327851
Scans reveal an astonishing absence of %F0v2 ships near their base. This is odd, so proceed with caution. However, you may also be catching them at a weak moment. 
327852
A group of our ships is already on the way to %Z0v1 to help out. Link up with them and they’ll be your backup. 
327853
Once you have engaged %F0v1, we’ll send in some ships to act as backup. 
327854
Understand that we do not have the resources to call in anyone else to help you out, so you’ll be working alone. 
327855
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a renegade and must be stopped. 
327856
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a renegade and must be stopped. 
327857
He has been spotted in %Z0v1. 
327858
You are to track him down, destroy his ship, and tractor in his %L0v1. 
327859
Then, deliver it back to %B, so we may give him what’s coming to him. 
327860
We’ve just received an update regarding %s0 %s1. 
327861
He’s just gotten into a ship carrying %L0v2. 
327862
We see this as a golden opportunity to get back at %F0v1. 
327863
We see this as a golden opportunity to get back at %F0v1. 
327864
We would like you to track him down, eliminate him and pick up %L0v3. 
327865
We understand that %F0v1 has hired a new operative to do some of their dirty work. 
327866
We understand that %F0v1 have hired an operative to do some of their dirty work. 
327867
%s0 %s1 is his name, and he’s good. 
327868
He was sent to acquire %L0v2, which he has done. Now the goods are on him, and he’s on his way to the drop. It’s the perfect time to strike. 
327869
You are to track him down and eliminate all evidence of %L0v3. 
327870
%s0 %s1, one of our more troublesome enemies, has just been spotted. 
327871
At the time of this sighting, he was just entering %Z0v1. We would like you to follow him and assassinate him quickly and quietly. 
327872
We want his death to linger in the minds of %F0v1. 
327873
We want his death to linger in the minds of %F0v1. 
327874
Be aware though, we think that %I0v1 may also be in the area where he was last seen. 
327875
We understand some %F0v2 ships have been causing a lot of trouble. We can’t allow that to continue. 
327876
We understand some %F0v2 ships have been causing a lot of trouble. We can’t allow that to continue. 
327877
Please fly out to %Z0v1 and rid us of those pests. 
327878
We aren’t sure, but there may also be %I0v1 out there as well, so be prepared. 
327879
To make your job easier, we sent out a few of our own people to prepare for your arrival. 
327880
We thought you could use some help, so once you get out there a group of %F0v2 ships will be dispatched to hook up with you. 
327881
Our ships will join you in %Z0v1 to act as backup. However, until they arrive you are on your own. 
327882
It’s clear %F0v1 has gone too far this time. 
327883
It’s clear %F0v1 have gone too far this time. 
327884
We’ve just identified %I0v1 and %I1v1 of theirs dangerously close to our own interests. 
327885
Your job is to go to %Z0v1 and to terminate that base at once. 
327886
Underground sources say that %F0v1 is finishing construction on a new base. 
327887
Underground sources say that %F0v1 are finishing construction on a new base. 
327888
We think they’re working on %I0v1. 
327889
We would like you to travel to %Z0v1 and prevent this from succeeding. Do whatever you have to. 
327890
We have noticed that %F0v1 is trying to increase their territory. It’s a feeble attempt. 
327891
We have noticed that %F0v1 are trying to increase their territory. It’s a feeble attempt. 
327892
Regardless, you are to fly to %Z0v1 and destroy their base. 
327893
Be sure to take out %I0v2. However, leave %I1v2 intact to serve as a painful reminder. 
327894
Between us, a new base belonging to %F0v1 has been sighted. 
327895
Between us, a new base belonging to %F0v1 has been sighted. 
327896
They only have %I0v1, but still, it can’t be tolerated. 
327897
The deal is: We are willing to shell out %d0 credits for its removal by a third party. 
327898
We suggest you take it. Fly out to %Z0v1 and get to work. 
327899
We do, of course, want you to kill all %F0v2 ships in that area, just to be sure. 
327900
Of course, we wouldn’t deprive you of additional kills. However, if you’re clever you’ll realize that you’re just being paid for this one sanction, not the collateral damage. Why waste your talents? 
327901
A scan of the area reveals a noticeable absence of %F0v2 ships around your target. Fools. They’ll never know what hit ’em. 
327902
We have already sent a few of our ships to %Z0v1. Rendezvous with them and they will help you accomplish your task. 
327903
Once you have engaged %F0v1, we will send in other ships to cover you. 
327904
Bear in mind that we will not be sending anyone else in to assist you. You will be operating on your own, so don’t do anything stupid. 
327905
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a wanted man and has just been ratted out. 
327906
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a wanted man and has just been ratted out. 
327907
One of his associates has informed us that he’s in %Z0v1. 
327908
We want you to track him down and smash his ship but salvage his %L0v1. 
327909
That way when you bring him back to %B, we will have something alive to start with when we exact retribution. 
327910
I am pleased to report that %F0v1 has finally made a critical mistake. 
327911
I am pleased to report that %F0v1 have finally made a critical mistake. 
327912
It appears that one of their number, %s0 %s1, has just been seen boarding a ship to move %L0v2. 
327913
At its last sighting, this ship was headed to %Z0v1. 
327914
We want you to find him, kill him, and pick up %L0v3 while you’re at it. 
327915
It seems %F0v1 has recently acquired something it shouldn’t have. 
327916
It seems %F0v1 have recently acquired something they shouldn’t have. 
327917
Apparently, %L0v2 fell into their hands. 
327918
More specifically, into %s0 %s1’s hands. 
327919
Too bad for him. We want you to find him, follow him, and then kill him. Destroy %L0v3 right then and there. We can’t afford to let that kind of cargo fall into enemy hands. 
327920
%F0v3 has been a thorn in our side for far too long. 
327921
%F0v3 have been a thorn in our side for far too long. 
327922
We’ve decided to make an example of one of their leaders, and we’ve chosen %s0 %s1. 
327923
He’s been tracked down to %Z0v1. 
327924
Fly out there and show him, and everyone else, what happens to people who cross %F0v1. 
327925
Fly out there and show him, and everyone else, what happens to people who cross %F0v1. 
327926
One final note, there is the possibility that your target has %I0v1 in the area. Move carefully. 
327927
A word from %Z0v1 is that there is a new infestation of scum out there. 
327928
This time it’s %F0v1. Time to call the exterminator, and that’s you. 
327929
This time it’s %F0v1. Time to call the exterminator, and that’s you. 
327930
Watch yourself though, there may also be %I0v1 operating out there as well. 
327931
In any case, we’ve already sent out some of our agents to act as your support on this mission. 
327932
So once you’re out there, a group of our ships will meet up with you and act as your cover. 
327933
We realize you may need some backup. However, until we can send a group of our ships to run interference for you in %Z0v1, you’ll be on your own out there. 
327934
Based on intelligence reports, we’ve been monitoring %F0v1 very closely lately. 
327935
Based on intelligence reports, we’ve been monitoring %F0v1 very closely lately. 
327936
Thanks to these efforts, we’ve noticed a lot of recent activity in %Z0v1. 
327937
Recon has identified %I0v1 and %I1v1 in this area. We cannot afford to let this group continue to expand its influence there. We want you to cut them down to size. 
327938
It’s no surprise that we’ve been having trouble with %F0v1, now more than ever. 
327939
It’s no surprise that we’ve been having trouble with %F0v1, now more than ever. 
327940
It seems every time we relax our grasp it’s perceived as a weakness, and others try to take advantage of it. Now there’s a new situation in %Z0v1. 
327941
We’ve just discovered that this group has completed the construction of %I0v1 there. Our position is simple: Now that we’ve found it, we need to take it down. Your mission is to strike this target and destroy it completely. 
327942
We need to strike a blow to the continued expansion of %F0v1. Hit them where it hurts. 
327943
We need to strike a blow to the continued expansion of %F0v1. Hit them where it hurts. 
327944
Intelligence reports they have a new base in %Z0v1. This seems like the perfect target of opportunity for us. 
327945
Your mission objective is to fly there and destroy their installation. Repeat: Only destroy %I0v2. You will leave %I1v2 untouched for now. 
327946
We’ve just discovered that %F0v1 has a new presence. 
327947
We’ve just discovered that %F0v1 have a new presence. 
327948
It’s a minor presence, I’ll grant you — just %I0v1. 
327949
However, we do still need it dealt with — and fairly soon. We are willing to pay you to fly to %Z0v1 and take care of this matter for us personally. 
327950
Once you are successful, you will receive %d0 credits and will have done us a great service. 
327951
As a side note, you are to engage all %F0v2 ships that you may encounter along the way. 
327952
You are also hereby authorized to destroy any other %F0v2 ships in the course of your mission. However, this is your option — you will be paid regardless. 
327953
In addition, intelligence says there don’t appear to be any additional %F0v2 ships in the area, so you may be in luck. 
327954
Our ships will rendezvous with you on the way to %Z0v1. They will act as your support to help you complete your mission. 
327955
Once you engage %F0v1, we will dispatch a backup contingent of ships to act as your support should you need them. 
327956
You will be acting alone on this mission. Unfortunately, we can’t spare any other pilots to back you up, so be careful. 
327957
One of our informants has identified the whereabouts of %s0 %s1, one of our most wanted. 
327958
Our confidence is high that he is in %Z0v1. 
327959
We want you to track him down there, destroy his ship, and retrieve his %L0v1. 
327960
Once he is in your custody, head to %B. We will take it from there. 
327961
Intelligence has just published its new findings on %F0v1. 
327962
Intelligence has just published its new findings on %F0v1. 
327963
Based on our analysis of this data, we have identified one of their operatives, %s0 %s1, as a valuable target. 
327964
He is currently between destinations — exposed — moving %L0v2. We want him intercepted. 
327965
You are authorized to track him down, destroy his ship and tractor in %L0v3. 
327966
It appears that our old friend %s0 %s1 hasn’t learned his lesson. 
327967
His activities with %F0v1 have now become a larger problem for us. 
327968
His activities with %F0v1 have now become a problem for us. 
327969
It appears that he has somehow acquired %L0v2. The time has come for us to act. 
327970
You are directed to locate him and eliminate %L0v3 once and for all. 
327971
Our patience with %F0v1 has grown thin. We can’t tolerate their actions any longer. 
327972
Our patience with %F0v1 has grown thin. We can’t tolerate their actions any longer. 
327973
Our profilers have identified one of their operatives, %s0 %s1, as a viable target. 
327974
We believe him to be vulnerable, in %Z0v1, right now. 
327975
You have orders to terminate him with extreme prejudice. His execution will send a clear message from %F0v1. 
327976
You have orders to terminate him with extreme prejudice. His execution will send a clear message from %F0v1. 
327977
Use caution, though. We believe that %I0v1 may be in the same area as your target and could be a danger. 
327978
We have word that several %F0v2 ships have just been identified. 
327979
We have word that several %F0v2 ships have just been identified. 
327980
You are to fly to %Z0v1 and engage them at once. Eliminate all hostile ships. 
327981
As a side note, it is possible that %I0v1 may be operating nearby, so approach with caution. 
327982
Meanwhile, we already have advance ships in the area. Hook up with them once you are out there. 
327983
Meanwhile, once you’ve made it to your destination, you will be joined by our support units. They will help you complete your mission. 
327984
Meanwhile, given our situation in %Z0v1, there is every likelihood that you will be acting alone. Stay frosty out there. 
327985
We’re starting to feel the pressure from %F0v1. 
327986
We’re starting to feel the pressure from %F0v1. 
327987
We’ve only now just discovered the source of our trouble to be %I0v1 and %I1v1, from which they are staging their attacks. 
327988
We want you to make your way to %Z0v1 and bring this incident to a close. Take them down. 
327989
We understand %F0v1 has embarked on a new plan. 
327990
We understand %F0v1 have embarked on a new plan. 
327991
They intend to construct %I0v1 from which they hope to sustain more effective assaults on our interests. 
327992
We can’t allow this to happen. The time to act is now. Your mission is to head to %Z0v1 and take down their installation. 
327993
We understand that %F0v1 has just installed a new base of operations. 
327994
We understand that the %F0v1 have just installed a new base of operations. 
327995
Now our own interests in and around %Z0v1 appear to be at risk. 
327996
Please go there and close down their operation. We think you can ignore %I1v2. Concentrate your fire on %I0v2, which is our main concern. 
327997
A new %F0v2 presence has just recently been discovered. 
327998
A new %F0v2 presence has just recently been discovered. 
327999
Apparently, they’ve set up a new base of operations in %Z0v1. 
328000
This may not seem like a problem for us now — it’s just %I0v1, after all — but it might be soon. So rather than undertake the unnecessary risk of removal ourselves, we’d rather pay you to do it for us. 
328001
For this favor, we are offering you %d0 credits. 
328002
Of course, we would also want you to destroy any %F0v2 ships you encounter along the way. It’s neater that way. 
328003
Of course, you may also engage and destroy any hostiles you encounter along the way. Either way, it won’t impact our deal. 
328004
We have it on good authority that there are no %F0v2 ships near this installation right now. Excellent. This may be the right time to strike. 
328005
You’ll find that a group of our ships has already been sent to %Z0v1 to back you up. That should give you an edge. 
328006
You will engage %F0v1 first, then expect a group of our ships to act as backup — purely a precaution. 
328007
You understand, of course, that you’ll be working completely alone on this. There’ll be no one to call for backup. 
328008
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has caused us trouble for the last time. 
328009
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has caused us trouble for the last time. 
328010
He has just been seen in %Z0v1. We want him badly. 
328011
Please go after him and destroy his ship. Once you have done this, tractor in his %L0v1. 
328012
Then return to %B…. He will pay for his transgressions. 
328013
We have just received information on the whereabouts of %s0 %s1. 
328014
Apparently, he’s currently in a ship carrying %L0v2. Now he’s vulnerable. 
328015
This is the best time to strike a blow against %F0v1. 
328016
This is the best time to strike a blow against %F0v1. 
328017
We want you to hunt him down, eliminate him, and tractor in %L0v3. 
328018
We understand that %F0v1 has someone new working for them. 
328019
We understand that %F0v1 have someone new working for them. 
328020
%s0 %s1 has been identified as a major player in a series of crimes. 
328021
He has now stolen %L0v2 and is looking to offload them quickly to his handlers. 
328022
We want you to act as a cleaner, eliminating him and all traces of %L0v3. 
328023
%s0 %s1, one of the most dangerous operatives we know, has just been betrayed by a turncoat. 
328024
We are told that he is in %Z0v1. Your job is to make sure that he doesn’t see another day. Eliminate him. 
328025
Under a new initiative, this will be the first of many such moves against %F0v1. 
328026
Under a new initiative, this will be the first of many such moves against %F0v1. 
328027
Be advised, there may be %I0v1 at work in the area as well, so keep your eyes open. 
328028
We’ve been enduring one attack after another from %F0v1. Now we have had enough. 
328029
We’ve been enduring one attack after another from %F0v1. Now we have had enough. 
328030
Make your way to %Z0v1 and kill them. Kill them all. 
328031
Be advised that %I0v1 may be operating out there as well, so be cautious. 
328032
To help you accomplish your task, we have already dispatched some ships to assist you. 
328033
To help you accomplish your task, a group of %F0v2 ships will be dispatched once you reach your destination. 
328034
Our ships will rendezvous with you in %Z0v1 to be your support, but until they get there, you will be solo. 
328035
The actions of %F0v1 can no longer be tolerated. 
328036
The actions of %F0v1 can no longer be tolerated. 
328037
Now we’ve discovered %I0v1 and %I1v1 of theirs, in a very sensitive area. 
328038
We want you to go to %Z0v1 and destroy this operation once and for all. 
328039
Our informants say that %F0v1 is about to activate a new installation of some sort. 
328040
Our informants say that %F0v1 are about to activate a new installation of some sort. 
328041
We believe this installation is %I0v1. This could spell trouble for us. 
328042
We want you to go to %Z0v1 and prevent this from happening. Destroy everything. 
328043
We’ve noticed that %F0v1 is sadly trying to increase its influence. 
328044
We’ve noticed that %F0v1 are sadly trying to increase their influence. 
328045
Your mission is to fly to %Z0v1 and destroy this attempt. 
328046
We want you to eliminate %I0v2. However, leave %I1v2 to remind them of their mistake. 
328047
Our sources have identified a new base belonging to %F0v1. 
328048
Our sources have identified a new base belonging to %F0v1. 
328049
There’s not much to it. They only have %I0v1. Still, we cannot afford to be lenient. 
328050
We think we can pay you %d0 credits for the removal of this irritation. 
328051
It’s a generous rate, so you should accept the work. Once you do, get right on it and head for %Z0v1. Don’t fail us. 
328052
Naturally, we want you to kill all %F0v2 ships in the area, just to be thorough. 
328053
You can kill what you like out there, but we’re only paying you for your actual work. 
328054
To our knowledge, there are no %F0v2 ships around your target. Great. Now’s your chance. 
328055
Rendezvous with our ships in %Z0v1. They will help you accomplish your mission. 
328056
Once you’ve drawn first blood from %F0v1, we’ll send in additional ships to cover you. 
328057
You should realize that it’s just you out there; there’s no one else coming. If you die or fail, that’s it. 
328058
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is owed some payback. 
328059
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is owed some payback. 
328060
One of his men has told us that he is in %Z0v1 now. 
328061
We want you to get on his trail and take him out, but then scoop up his %L0v1. 
328062
Then we want you to make your way back to %B, so vengeance can be properly satisfied. 
328063
It seems %F0v1 has finally blundered. 
328064
It seems %F0v1 have finally blundered. 
328065
One of their men, %s0 %s1, has just boarded a ship to shift %L0v2. 
328066
Now’s our chance. The ship is heading into %Z0v1 — and our trap. 
328067
We want you to find him, kill him, and snag %L0v3 to boot. 
328068
So, %F0v1 has now done something new. 
328069
So, %F0v1 have now done something new. 
328070
Apparently, they’ve managed to snag %L0v2. 
328071
It’s clear, however, that %s0 %s1’s the mastermind behind this affront. 
328072
That makes him a very popular corpse in our book. Your mission is to acquire and then terminate him. Meanwhile, destroy %L0v3 while you’re at it, just to be on the safe side. 
328073
%F0v3 has been on our death list for a long time. 
328074
%F0v3 have been on our death list for a long time. 
328075
We’ve finally decided to assassinate one of their more visible leaders, %s0 %s1. 
328076
Fortunately, we’ve managed to locate him in %Z0v1. 
328077
We want you to go out there and give him a love letter from %F0v1 — one he won’t ever recover from. 
328078
We want you to go out there and give him a love letter from %F0v1 — one he won’t ever recover from. 
328079
One small detail: There is the chance that your target might be near %I0v1 in the area. Keep an eye out. 
328080
We’ve heard recently from %Z0v1, and there appears to be a problem out there. 
328081
It seems %F0v1 has overstepped its bounds. Time to teach them a lesson they won’t forget. 
328082
It seems %F0v1 have overstepped their bounds. Time to teach them a lesson they won’t forget. 
328083
However, be careful. There may also be %I0v1 operating out there as well. 
328084
In any case, we’ve already sent out some of our agents to serve as your backup. Hook up with them along the way. 
328085
In any case, a group of our ships will meet up with you once you arrive. They will act as your cover in this operation. 
328086
Unfortunately, we can only do so much right now. If you get into trouble in %Z0v1, you’re on your own out there. 
328087
Military Intelligence has had the movements of %F0v1 under close surveillance recently. 
328088
Military Intelligence has had the movements of %F0v1 under close surveillance recently. 
328089
We noticed increased comm. traffic and a jump in activity in %Z0v1, so we sent a recon team in to investigate. 
328090
They have reported that %I0v1 and %I1v1 have just come online in that area. Now we need you to go there and take down the installation. 
328091
Things have gone from bad to worse with %F0v1. 
328092
Things have gone from bad to worse with %F0v1. 
328093
Despite our best efforts, they have violated what little trust we had by building a new installation in %Z0v1. 
328094
The presence of %I0v1 out there changes everything. We can’t allow this kind of escalation. Therefore, your mission is to eliminate this problem for us. 
328095
We need to do something that will stop %F0v1 in its tracks. 
328096
We need to do something that will stop %F0v1 in their tracks. 
328097
We have identified one of their installations in %Z0v1 that should make a good target. 
328098
We want you to go there and take out that base. However, be sure to eliminate only %I0v2. We want you to leave %I1v2 alone to serve as a reminder to them. 
328099
Foolishly, %F0v1 has been making some minor attempts to move again. 
328100
Foolishly, %F0v1 have been making some minor attempts to move again. 
328101
We have just identified %I0v1 of theirs in a brand-new area. 
328102
This is a minor annoyance for us. However, we still can’t allow them to get a better foothold in that region. We are therefore willing to hire you to head to %Z0v1 and eliminate this nuisance for us. 
328103
Once you have completed this task, you will receive %d0 credits and our gratitude. Both are worth having, I assure you. 
328104
Naturally, we will also require you to destroy any %F0v2 ships that you may encounter along the way. 
328105
Naturally, feel free to destroy any other %F0v2 ships that you may encounter along the way. However, this is entirely up to you. 
328106
The area appears to be clear of any additional %F0v2 ships, so this may be a clean mission. Take advantage of it. 
328107
You will rendezvous with a support group of ships as you head to %Z0v1. Rely on them to help you complete your mission. 
328108
As you engage %F0v1, we will direct a support group of ships to meet you. Rely on them to help you complete your mission. 
328109
You will also be flying solo on this one, so don’t take any unnecessary risks. 
328110
After days of interrogation, one of our sources has finally told us where %s0 %s1 is. We’ve been after him for a long time…. 
328111
We are now fairly certain that he has been hiding out in %Z0v1. 
328112
Your mission is to track him down out there, destroy his ship, and recover his %L0v1. 
328113
Once you have custody, set your course for %B. We will take delivery there. 
328114
We’ve had our eye on %F0v1 for some time now. 
328115
We’ve had our eye on %F0v1 for some time now. 
328116
We think the time is right to take out one of their more senior operatives, %s0 %s1. 
328117
We understand that he is in transit right now, carrying %L0v2. We don’t want him to reach his destination. 
328118
You are to find and eliminate this target, then tractor in %L0v3. Be discreet and be accurate. We can’t afford to blow this. 
328119
We have a problem that requires some immediate attention, and its name is %s0 %s1. 
328120
He has been very busy lately with %F0v1. 
328121
He has been very busy lately with %F0v1. 
328122
Now that he’s acquired %L0v2, he’s become more trouble than he is worth. 
328123
Your mission is to locate this irritant and eliminate %L0v3 once and for all. 
328124
The time has come to move against %F0v1. 
328125
The time has come to move against %F0v1. 
328126
Intelligence has identified the whereabouts of one of their more high-profile members, %s0 %s1. 
328127
As near as we can tell, he is going to be in %Z0v1 shortly. This will provide the perfect opportunity for us to act. 
328128
Your mission is to hunt him down and execute him on the spot. They will learn to respect %F0v1. 
328129
Your mission is to hunt him down and execute him on the spot. They will learn to respect %F0v1. 
328130
However, we also understand that there may be %I0v1 operating in the area, so use caution. 
328131
A reconnaissance unit has reported that several %F0v2 ships have just been spotted. 
328132
A reconnaissance unit has reported that several %F0v2 ships have just been spotted. 
328133
We need you to fly to %Z0v1 and eliminate them all. 
328134
Be advised, there may also be %I0v1 operating in the area. 
328135
Meanwhile, some ships have already been dispatched. They will be expecting you. 
328136
Meanwhile, support units will rendezvous with you once you’ve made it to your destination. Count on them to help you complete your mission. 
328137
Meanwhile, you will be operating completely alone out in %Z0v1. Do not fail us. 
328138
We’re getting a lot of heat from %F0v1 now. 
328139
We’re getting a lot of heat from %F0v1 now. 
328140
We just got word that they’ve been staging their assaults from %I0v1 and %I1v1. It’s time to take them out. 
328141
Go to %Z0v1 at once and clean house. Leave no trace. 
328142
We’ve just received some worrying news about %F0v1. 
328143
We’ve just received some worrying news about %F0v1. 
328144
We understand that they’re in the process of constructing %I0v1. 
328145
Naturally, we cannot allow this shift in the balance of power. We want you to fly to %Z0v1 and eliminate this problem before it gets out of control. 
328146
We now know that %F0v1 has just established a new base of operations. 
328147
We now know that %F0v1 have just established a new base of operations. 
328148
This raises grave concerns for us in %Z0v1. 
328149
We want you to fly out there and eliminate %I0v2. Don’t bother with %I1v2, focus only on your main objective. 
328150
We’ve just been informed of a new %F0v2 situation. 
328151
We’ve just been informed of a new %F0v2 situation. 
328152
They have apparently set up a new facility in %Z0v1. 
328153
This facility is minor, merely %I0v1. However just to be safe, we want you to dismantle this operation as soon as possible. 
328154
In return for this quick, discreet intervention, you will be paid %d0 credits. 
328155
Additionally, we want you to eliminate all %F0v2 ships you come in contact with. 
328156
Additionally, feel free to take on any other hostiles you run into along the way. You’ll be paid regardless. 
328157
There appear to be no %F0v2 ships in the area. That could be a good sign, so move quickly while you have the advantage. 
328158
We’ve already alerted a group of our ships to head to %Z0v1. They will rendezvous with you and serve as your backup. 
328159
Once you have engaged %F0v1, a group of our ships will arrive and serve as your backup. 
328160
Understand that under the circumstances, you’ll be on your own out there. 
328161
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a danger to society and must be taken down. 
328162
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a danger to society and must be taken down. 
328163
He has just been seen in %Z0v1. This is our chance. 
328164
We want you to track him down, destroy his ship and pick up his %L0v1. 
328165
Then, return to %B so he can face justice. 
328166
We’ve just received information regarding the criminal %s0 %s1. 
328167
We now understand that he is en route to a new destination, carrying %L0v2. 
328168
This is the moment we’ve been waiting for. This should send a message straight to %F0v1. 
328169
This is the moment we’ve been waiting for. This should send a message straight to %F0v1. 
328170
We want you to find him, eliminate him and pick up %L0v3. 
328171
We are told that %F0v1 has brought in a specialist for something big. 
328172
We are told that %F0v1 have brought in a specialist for something big. 
328173
%s0 %s1 is his name and he’s supposed to be good — very good. 
328174
His target was %L0v2, which he has now already acquired. We think that if we act fast, we can stop him from turning over the goods. 
328175
We want you to find him and destroy every trace of %L0v3. 
328176
%s0 %s1, a long-time thorn in our side, has just been seen. 
328177
He is headed into %Z0v1, the perfect place to disappear. We want you to help him do so, by finding and killing him before he resurfaces somewhere else. 
328178
We want %F0v1 to suspect that we did it, but we don’t want them to have any physical proof. Take every precaution. 
328179
We want %F0v1 to suspect that we did it, but we don’t want them to have any physical proof. Take every precaution. 
328180
Of course, it is entirely possible that %I0v1 may also be at work in the area too, so be very careful. 
328181
A group of %F0v2 ships appears to have been causing a lot of hassle lately. 
328182
A group of %F0v2 ships appears to have been causing a lot of hassle lately. 
328183
We want you to head to %Z0v1 and put a stop to them — permanently. 
328184
There may also be %I0v1 out there too, so take extra precautions. 
328185
To help you, we’ve sent out a few of our ships to prepare for your arrival. 
328186
Once you get out there, a group of %F0v2 ships will arrive to back you up. 
328187
Even though our ships will join you in %Z0v1, you’ll be without backup and totally alone until they arrive, so be careful. 
328188
Well, %F0v1 has crossed the line now. 
328189
Well, %F0v1 have crossed the line now. 
328190
We’ve just ID’d %I0v1 and %I1v1 of theirs. They are not in a good place. 
328191
You’re to go at once to %Z0v1 and terminate that operation post haste. 
328192
The underground says %F0v1 has nearly finished building a new installation. 
328193
The underground says %F0v1 have nearly finished building a new installation. 
328194
We didn’t know what it was at first, but now all evidence points to it being %I0v1. 
328195
You are to go to %Z0v1 and prevent this from happening. 
328196
We believe %F0v1 is trying to increase its presence. 
328197
We believe %F0v1 are trying to increase their presence. 
328198
Fly to %Z0v1 at once and destroy their new installation. 
328199
Take out %I0v2, but leave %I1v2 as a monument to their failure. 
328200
It appears a new installation belonging to %F0v1 has just been identified. Well, it’s at least part of an installation anyway. 
328201
It appears a new installation belonging to %F0v1 has been identified. Well, at least it’s part of an installation anyway. 
328202
Though it may only be %I0v1, that’s enough to cause us concern. 
328203
In any case, we will pay you %d0 credits to eliminate this problem for us. Make it go away. 
328204
You should fly to %Z0v1 at once and get to work as soon as possible. 
328205
Just to be sure, we do want you to kill all %F0v2 ships you encounter. 
328206
Our deal covers this kill and this kill alone. Any other fighting you do, you are doing for free. 
328207
We’ve noticed an unusual ebb in %F0v2 ships around your intended target. Excellent. That will work in your favor. 
328208
Rendezvous with our ships in %Z0v1. They will act as your support and help you complete your mission. 
328209
Once you have engaged %F0v1, a group of our ships will arrive to assist you in mopping up. 
328210
You’ll have no backup on this mission. Remember, you will be operating on your own, so be careful. 
328211
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has finally been betrayed! 
328212
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has finally been betrayed! 
328213
We now know, thanks to one of his associates, that he’s traveling in %Z0v1 at this moment. 
328214
We want you to track him down, destroy his ship, and pick up his %L0v1. 
328215
That way when you report back to %B, we can administer our own brand of justice. 
328216
It looks like %F0v1 just blew it. 
328217
It looks like %F0v1 just blew it. 
328218
Seems that one of their guys, %s0 %s1, has just been seen boarding a ship to shift %L0v2. 
328219
He’s on his way into %Z0v1, we are told. This is a great opportunity for us to act. 
328220
We want you to find him, knock him off and scoop up %L0v3. 
328221
It looks like %F0v1 has just stuck its nose in too deep. Now it’ll get cut off. 
328222
It looks like %F0v1 have just stuck their nose in too deep. Now it’ll get cut off. 
328223
Apparently, they’ve somehow managed to get their hands on %L0v2. 
328224
Or rather, they were %s0 %s1’s hands. 
328225
In response to this, we want you to find and then kill him. Also destroy %L0v3 on the spot. We can’t afford to let that kind of cargo just float around. 
328226
%F0v3 has been a great source of pain for us recently. 
328227
%F0v3 have been a great source of pain for us recently. 
328228
We’ve managed to identify and isolate the whereabouts of their leader, %s0 %s1. 
328229
Apparently, he is in %Z0v1. That’s a lucky break for us, and one we won’t waste. 
328230
Your mission is to fly out there and give him a message from %F0v1 — a final message. 
328231
Your mission is to fly out there and give him a message from %F0v1 — a final message. 
328232
Bear in mind that there is every possibility that %I0v1 may be at work there too. Watch yourself. 
328233
Word has it from %Z0v1 that there is an undesirable presence there now. 
328234
This time it’s %F0v1. We need a cleaner out there to fix this problem and we need him fast. 
328235
This time it’s %F0v1. We need a cleaner out there to fix this problem and we need him fast. 
328236
However, be careful. There may also be %I0v1 operating out there as well. Just be cautious and you should be alright. 
328237
Meanwhile, we’ve already sent out some units to act as your support on this mission. They’ll help you out. 
328238
So once you’re out there, a group of our ships will meet up with you and serve as your cover. They’ll help you out. 
328239
You might need some help out there. However, until we have another wing free, you’ll be acting on your own. Basically, you’re solo on this one, so take it easy. Do your job and do it right.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I've heard that there have been clusters of Rheinland ships seen gathering around every way in and out of New Berlin.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Have you seen the news? This is bad. I hear the Chancellor even suspects someone in his own government may be feeding sensitive information to the Kusari, who in turn use it in covert operations against him.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I'm not really a student of history, but I understand the Boorman Treaty has been in place since the colonies were founded and the first Libertonians discovered the other settlements.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>You know this is very bad for business, but thankfully Liberty presides over the colonies and the High Court for a reason. Still, I've been hearing some rumblings from inside the government and growing concern that if the Chancellor loses it completely, he could do some serious damage to Kusari before anyone could stop him. Well, it's up to us to keep that from happening and to restore the status quo. I know the President feels this way, and we are all behind her.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Have you heard the news? What the hell is the Chancellor playing at? We have consistently been his only real ally all of these years. Even the cabinet is outraged at this move of his, and they've always been slow to act. Irrespective of whether or not he is insane, the Queen simply will not stand for this.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

And by the way, I don't believe for a second that that Ballenshine bloke went belly-up all by himself either. Somebody helped him along, and they're just trying to cover it up. That's what I think. I mean think about it. First they kill Liberty’s man, and now ours. What better way to sabotage the summit.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393666
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Things are heating up in Rheinland. I just got back from Hamburg and there is an active effort going on from some kind of "agitators" to try and stir the people against Kusari. They’re doing a pretty good job of it, too. Meanwhile, the Chancellor himself has started a program to get the younger people into immediate military service. He’s taking on hundreds of new recruits every day. This isn't some kind of "defensive action" like they are saying. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I’d be careful going out into the frontier if I were you. If the Border Worlds were rough before, they’re no place to be now. Not only are the Rheinland goons making it hard for us to get by out there, but I also heard some gas miner rummy blabbing about some kind of strange ship he’d seen that just "shimmered away." Probably the alcohol talking, but he’s not alone -- I heard a couple of other pilots reported seeing something weird out there, and were going to investigate.They didn’t come home.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Thank God the Queen wasn’t hurt on Curacao. She's still sequestered in her own quarters waiting for the session to be recalled. I hear that Gunther Obst was only narrowly missed in the attack -- and is outraged - understandably. This is the first time I’ve ever heard of anyone from The Order ever being captured alive, but he clearly was familiar with the layout and security to have make it in that far. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>What do you think about Liberty and the artifact ban? I mean, you know how Liberty is -- credits, credits, credits. I used to think it was all a smoke screen but now I’m not so sure. Supposedly Jacobi’s been talking to the Queen for a while in private about the importance of the artifact ban and the potential threat to Bretonia; she wants us to extend the ban here, too. No worries, though. The Queen is young but she's smart and has good people around her. If there’s any kind of real danger I believe she'll act in our best interests. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393670
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>If it was The Order’s mission to disrupt the conference, they did a good job, even if they missed Mr. Obst. Now he says Kusari is trying to kill him? I hear the assassin they captured died in his cell before he could be questioned -- OD’d on Cardamine, injected a massive dose right into his own heart. Surprised they didn’t catch that when they searched him. Pity. I wanted to hear if Kusari really does have ties to The Order.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393671
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>You know, there is a whole group of Kusari people -- merchants, pilots, regular blokes -- stuck in Rheinland and not allowed to return home. I hear the local police are leaning on them pretty heavily. They're being unlawfully detained, questioned, searched, and their property illegally confiscated. I also hear the Chancellor is starting to see conspiracy everywhere now; he’s even looking for spies in his own family -- people he’s known for years.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393672
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I hear that Rheinland might be right in thinking that Kusari is up to something. Apparently, there's an indication that Kusari agents have tried to steal some kind of new ship technology from one of Rheinland's top secret installations. This is obviously not something they can very well broadcast but it wouldn't surprise me, though. The Kusari are known to be very aggressive about acquiring new toys for their own purposes. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393673
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>This thing with Rheinland is getting worse all of the time. Poor Kusari devils. And now Jacobi’s sticking her nose deep into it. I’m glad we have the good sense to look at all the facts and not pretend to be the bloody “universal peacekeepers." I mean really -- the gall, the unmitigated self-importance of Liberty. Sod the Boorman Treaty. Each colony’s got to do what’s right for them. Thankfully, we’re steering clear. That’s probably why our people can still get around Rheinland with no problem. </TEXT><PARA/><TEXT> </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393674
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I heard there really was a bomb found in the wreckage of the Kusari medical convoy. It's supposed to be made of something really nasty. Instead of just destroying its target, it eliminates everything organic and inorganic and renders the whole area toxic to all life. These guys weren't on any medical run. They must have intended that charge to take out something big. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393675
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I hear that Niemann has told his people that they are no longer beholding to the High Court. That’s strange when you consider that he was once its biggest supporter and was the one pushing to extend its charter and scope. I’ve always thought he was a man who loved freedom and justice, but now he’s acting like a paranoid warmonger. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393676
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>If you’re heading out into Rheinland anytime soon, just watch yourself. I hear there are more military and police around than normal, and they get pretty ill-tempered, even with neutrals. I've even heard that they've mined some of the Border Worlds systems. If you ask me, they’re gearing up for something major -- I just hope we’re not on the menu.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393677
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Well, that about wraps it up for a settlement, I’d say. Nobody’s ever going to go back to that table. Not Rheinland -- and definitely not Kusari – at least not 'til something significant changes.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>This is going to single-handedly sink the market, let me tell you. Merchants -- not just here, but all over -- are starting to really feel it.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>What they’re not telling us is that the Rheinlanders aren’t just sending some ships over. They’ve developed a new kind of ship -- one that can cloak. That's what I heard, at least. Got a friend whose brother works for the Signals Corp. He says they’re worried, and with good reason. It’s the perfect recon and first strike weapon. No evidence -- total surprise.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393680
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I suppose if anyone could make the President see our side of things, it would be Governor Tekagi. Have you heard the lies that Niemann has been spreading, that we're the ones who support The Order? We have been doing everything possible to discover the whereabouts of The Order! The only reason we've had no trouble with them is because of the structure of our society, not because we support them. Everyone here has a role; everyone has a purpose. There is total dedication with no opportunity for perversion or infiltration by foreign influences -- er, no offense to you, of course.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393681
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I hear that several Bretonian merchants inside Rheinland were successful in smuggling out some of our people.

They have no idea what happened to them. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393682
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>You know, there are plenty of Rheinlanders here and in the rest of the colonies who don’t feel the same way as the Chancellor does about the Kusari people. This atmosphere of distrust makes things difficult not just for them, but for everyone. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393683
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Someone on the inside tells me that one of the reasons why we're so concerned about security isn’t just because of The Order, but because two high-ranking Bretonian intelligence operatives have recently been replaced in the Queen’s party. I dug a little more and found that these people weren’t reassigned -- they disappeared. Naturally, this has been suppressed, but it's causing a great deal of alarm in the intelligence community. If this report is true, how can anyone guarantee the safety and security of our own people or the information they carry?</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393684
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I don’t trust Liberty anymore. I’ve actually heard that they are secretly working with Rheinland to divide us on two fronts, and then come in to bleed us dry of our resources and technology. It’s in total disregard of the Boorman Treaty -- that they themselves set up, but that’s the way they operate. They stand behind the law as long as it serves their interests. I've even heard they’ve been kidnapping some of our best scientists and forcing them to work on some secret project.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393685
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>You know, despite the harsh feelings around here about Liberty and the Artifact ban, it doesn’t make sense that they’re trying to get this under government control just for a few more credits. Before my Liberty contact was reassigned, I heard of "vast fields of impounded Artifacts" in Zone-21 and learned that the Artifacts are being carefully examined by “special personnel." It sounds more like they’re looking for something specific and they wanted some place very private to look for it. This expanded impound will just give them more to sift through.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393686
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I don’t believe it. It sounds as if the Governor actually intends to meet with that Rheinland animal! What makes him think that he won’t be arrested once he sets foot in Rheinland space? I hear the Chancellor is so paranoid that he's sequestered himself in a fortified room and surrounded himself with guards, allowing only his inner circle inside. It's madness for the Governor to undertake this mission.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
393687
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I hear that the Chancellor has a group of psi-gifted advisors who are now guarding him against any possible danger.

They're never quite the same after they return.</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT> [kw1]What does this mean?</TEXT><PARA/><TEXT> [/af2]Psi: It's short for psionics.  It's not unlike ESP sensitivity or even telekinetic ability. </TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I heard from the palace staff that even though the Shogun did agree to support the artifact ban, he's not taking any kind of immediate action.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>You can tell from the news that our people were treated horribly. Rheinland has no shame.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Rumors about The Order are starting to circulate again. I hear the Shogun has increased the resources devoted to investigating them and doubled the number of Imperial Guards around him and Governor Tekagi. The strange thing is, I haven’t heard of The Order operating anywhere near Kusari, let alone threatening the government. Still, they're probably right to be cautious now that things will be settling down again.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?><RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Have you heard? It’s war! The Chancellor has double-crossed us!

For sometime he’s been seeding unrest in the working class and now he’s turning up the heat with the threat of attack. Just the specter of war is all that it will take for the system to start breaking down.

Boron fibers are infused into the panels to endow them with structural rigidity, protecting ships against kinetic impact and high-energy weapons fire.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

We have amassed a decent stock of them already, but we would still pay you a fair amount for any you bring back here. — If you consider yourself up for that challenge, I suppose the more efficient your torpedo runs are, the higher your profit will be...just don’t underestimate those capital fleets.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I wish I could talk about some of the new things my division just discovered about the Nomad hull structure, but strictly speaking I’m not supposed to talk with an uninvolved agent like you about having discovered anything at all.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Beyond the megalithic Daam-K’Vosh jump gate hidden in the nebula, there is an even more megalithic structure: A Dyson sphere. It does not clearly show up on any telemetry, and the Edge flows around it like any other star system. Alpha and Delta squadron visit the system regularly to scan for developments, but do not enter the structure itself. That would be suicide.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>My assignment takes me to the system with the megastructure on a regular basis. First we establish a path through the opening in front of the gate, then I take half my squadron through. We stay until we have the desired amount of data or until the Nomad response gets too hot. My old tutor at West Point said that there is science in every combat deployment, back then I didn’t consider taking that literally.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>This entire system is generally hostile. No man operates here other than us, the nebula is actively trying to turn your hull into its molecular parts and Nomads will prey on any human activity, whether it’s us or you. If you must venture out and you don’t want to end up as a molecular cloud in this space, I would advice you to keep an eye out for where our patrol paths are, both to have a chance at backup as well as perhaps backing up us, if you can.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Have you encountered a Vanguard yet? Those are large Nomads, and the primary reason the Osiris cannot operate freely in the system right now. They are difficult to deal with for this ship because they move in pairs — the necessary repairs to the Osiris even when we stuff one after the other full of torpedos means any victory over a Vanguard battle group is a pyrrhic one, and I haven’t even mentioned their fighter escort.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I’m a combat pilot under Colonel Rathinger. We do some special tasks — that’s all I’ll say. Regardless, the Nomads do not stick to a neat task schedule, so unless we are freshly recovering from a special mission, we are expected to be combat ready at all times for when the ship comes under assault by a Nomad squadron. Usually it’s just fighters, sometimes a gunship. Torpedo runs are the quickest way to deal with those.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Upkeep on this ship would be impossible to manage without our connections.
